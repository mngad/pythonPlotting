@article{Studies2006,
	Abstract = {Compression fracture of the vertebral body is common, especially in older adults. Vertebral compression fractures usually are caused by osteoporosis, and range from mild to severe. More severe fractures can cause significant pain, leading to inability to perform activities of daily living, and life-threatening decline in the elderly patient who already has decreased reserves. While the diagnosis can be suspected from history and physical examination, plain roentgenography, as well as occasional computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, are often helpful in accurate diagnosis and prognosis. Traditional conservative treatment includes bed rest, pain control, and physical therapy. Interventional procedures such as vertebroplasty can be considered in those patients who do not respond to initial treatment. Family physicians can help patients prevent compression fractures by diagnosing and treating predisposing factors, identifying high-risk patients, and educating patients and the public about measures to prevent falls.},

@article{wachowski2013does,
	Abstract = {We analyze how kinematic properties of C3/C4-segments are modified after total disc arthroplasty (TDA) with PRESTIGE({\textregistered}) and BRYAN({\textregistered}) Cervical Discs. The measurements were focused on small ranges of axial rotation ({\textless}0.8$\,^{\circ}$) in order to investigate physiologic rotations, which frequently occur in vivo. Eight human segments were stimulated by triangularly varying, axially directed torque. By using a 6D-measuring device with high resolution the response of segmental motion was characterised by the instantaneous helical axis (IHA). Position, direction, and migration rate of the IHA were measured before and after TDA. External parameters: constant axially directed pre-load, constant flexional/extensional and lateral-flexional pre-torque. The applied axial torque and IHA-direction did not run parallel. The IHA-direction was found to be rotated backwards and largely independent of the rotational angle, amount of axial pre-load, size of pre-torque, and TDA. In the intact segments pre-flexion/extension hardly influenced IHA-positions. After TDA, IHA-position was shifted backwards significantly (BRYAN-TDA: ≈8mm; PRESTIGE-TDA: ≈6mm) and in some segments laterally as well. Furthermore it was significantly shifted ventrally by pre-flexion and dorsally by pre-extension. The rate of lateral IHA-migration increased significantly after BRYAN-TDA during rightward or leftward rotations. In conclusion after the TDA the IHA-positions shifted backwards with significant increase in variability of the IHA-positions after the BRYAN-TDA more than in PRESTIGE-TDA. The TDA-procedure altered the segment kinematics considerably. TDA causes additional translations of the vertebrae, which superimpose the kinematics of the adjacent levels. The occurrence of adjacent level disease (ALD) is not excluded after the TDA for kinematical reasons.},

	Abstract = {This study details the quantitative three-dimensional surface anatomy of thoracic vertebrae based on a study of 144 vertebrae. The thoracic spine was found to have three distinct regions: upper, middle, and lower segments. The two end segments appear to be transitional zones toward cervical and lumbar regions. The middle zone (T3 to T9) is of utmost importance due to the presence of the combination of narrow spinal canal and critical vascular supply. Means and standard errors of the means for linear, angular, and area dimensions of vertebral bodies, spinal canal, pedicle, pars articularis, spinous and transverse processes, and rib articulations are provided for all thoracic vertebrae. This information is necessary for constructing accurate mathematical models of the human spine. It will also provide a better understanding of the spine, and allow for a more precise clinical and surgical management of spinal problems.},

The tissues around cementless metal-on-bone and ceramic-on-ceramic prostheses contained few or no prosthesis wear particles. The tissues around metal-on-metal prostheses contained large numbers of metal particles and large numbers of macrophages, and occasional multinucleate giant cells. The tissues around cemented metal-on-polyethylene prostheses often contained large numbers of small and large polyethylene particles, variable numbers of cement particles, and occasional metal particles. Large numbers of macrophages and multinucleate giant cells were frequently seen in these tissues. Lymphocytes were occasionally seen in association with metal particles. Ultrastructural studies of the periprosthetic tissues confirmed the phagocytosis of submicroscopic wear particles by macrophages. Varying degrees of degenerative change in macrophages were seen in association with phagocytosis of metal particles. Large numbers of cytolysosomes were seen in cells in association with the accumulation of wear particles.},

@article{mo2014biomechanical,
	Abstract = {PURPOSE: Various design concepts have been adopted in cervical disc prostheses, including sliding articulation and standalone configuration. This study aimed to evaluate the biomechanical effects of the standalone U-shaped configuration on the cervical spine. METHODS: Based on an intact finite element model of C3-C7, a standalone U-shaped implant (DCI) was installed at C5-C6 and compared with a sliding articulation design (Prodisc-C) and an anterior fusion system. The range of motion (ROM), adjacent intradiscal pressure (IDP) and capsular ligament strain were calculated under different spinal motions. RESULTS: Compared to the intact configuration, the ROM at C5-C6 was reduced by 90{\%} after fusion, but increased by 70{\%} in the Prodisc-C model, while the maximum percentage change in the DCI model was 30{\%} decrease. At the adjacent segments, up to 32{\%} increase in ROM happened after fusion, while up to 34{\%} decrease occurred in Prodisc-C model and 17{\%} decrease in DCI model. The IDP increased by 11.6{\%} after fusion, but decreased by 5.6 and 6.3{\%} in the DCI and Prodisc-C model, respectively. The capsular ligament strain increased by 147{\%} in Prodisc-C and by 13{\%} in the DCI model. The DCI implant exhibited a high stress distribution. CONCLUSIONS: Spinal fusion resulted in compensatory increase of ROM at the adjacent sites, thereby elevating the IDP. Prodisc-C resulted in hyper-mobility at the operative site that led to an increase of ligament force and strain. The U-shaped implant could maintain the spinal kinematics and impose minimum influence on the adjacent soft tissues, despite the standalone configuration encountering the disadvantages of high stress distribution.},

@article{Clark2016,
	Abstract = {Background We hypothesised that vertebroplasty provides effective analgesia for patients with poorly controlled pain and osteoporotic spinal fractures of less than 6 weeks' duration. The effectiveness of vertebroplasty, using an adequate vertebral fill technique, in fractures of less than 6 weeks' duration has not been specifically assessed by previously published masked trials. Methods This was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of vertebroplasty in four hospitals in Sydney, Australia. We recruited patients with one or two osteoporotic vertebral fractures of less than 6 weeks' duration and Numeric Rated Scale (NRS) back pain greater than or equal to 7 out of 10. We used an automated telephone randomisation service provided by the National Health and Medical Research Council to assign patients (1:1; stratified according to age, degree of vertebral compression, trauma, corticosteroid use, and hospital) to either vertebroplasty or placebo, immediately before the procedure. Patients received conscious sedation. Vertebroplasty was done with the adequate vertebral fill technique and the placebo procedure with simulated vertebroplasty. Follow-up was for 6 months. Outcome assessors and patients were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with NRS pain below 4 out of 10 at 14 days post-intervention in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01482793. Findings Between Nov 4, 2011, and Dec 5, 2014, 120 patients were enrolled. 61 patients were randomly assigned to vertebroplasty and 59 to placebo. 24 (44{\%}) patients in the vertebroplasty group and 12 (21{\%}) in the control group had an NRS pain score below 4 out of 10 at 14 days (between-group difference 23 percentage points, 95{\%} CI 6???39; p=0??011). Three patients in each group died from causes judged unrelated to the procedure. There were two serious adverse events in each group, related to the procedure (vertebroplasty group) and the fracture (control group). Interpretation Vertebroplasty is superior to placebo intervention for pain reduction in patients with acute osteoporotic spinal fractures of less than 6 weeks' in duration. These findings will allow patients with acute painful fractures to have an additional means of pain management that is known to be effective. Funding Education grant from CareFusion Corporation.},

	Abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: We quantified the segmental biomechanics of a cervical total disc replacement (TDR) before and after progressive posterior decompression. We hypothesized that posterior decompressive procedures would not significantly increase range of motion (ROM) at the index TDR level.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVE: To quantify the kinematics of a cervical total disc replacement (TDR) before and after posterior cervical decompression.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: A reported yet unaddressed issue is the potential for the development of same-segment disease after implantation of a cervical TDR and the implications of same-segment posterior decompression on TDR mechanics.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Eight human cadaveric cervical spines C3-C7 were tested in flexion-extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation while intact, after C5-C6 TDR, C5-C6 unilateral foraminotomy, C5-C6 bilateral foraminotomies, and after C5 laminectomy in combination with the bilateral foraminotomies. Moment versus angular motion curves were obtained for each testing step, and the load-displacement data were analyzed to determine the range of angular motion for each step.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Unilateral foraminotomy did not result in a statistically significant increase in flexion-extension ROM, and did not increase the ROM to a degree greater than normal. Although bilateral foraminotomies did increase flexion-extension ROM, motion remained within a physiological range. A full laminectomy added to the bilateral foraminotomies significantly increased ROM and was also associated with distortion of the load-displacement curves.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: With respect to segmental biomechanics as demonstrated, we think that for same-segment disease, a unilateral foraminotomy can be performed safely. However, the impact of in vivo conditions was not accounted for in this model, and it is possible that cyclical loading and other physiological stresses on such a construct may affect the behavior and lifespan of the implant in a way that cannot be predicted by a biomechanical study. Bilateral foraminotomies would require close observation and additional clinical follow-up, whereas complete laminectomy combined with bilateral foraminotomies should be avoided after TDR given the significant changes in kinematics. In addition, future disc replacement designs may need to account for changes after posterior decompression for same-segment disease.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nLEVEL OF EVIDENCE: N/A.},

Measurements were based on five bony reference points, which can be defined in radiographs. The measurements permit the determination of nine dimensions that can be used for anthropometrical evaluation of the cervical and lumbar vertebrae. A simplified model of the vertebra in the sagittal plane is presented and serves as a basis for the geometrical measurements. In the cervical region, average width exceeded average height of vertebral bodies C3 to C7, while in C2 the average width was smaller than the average height; C7 was the longest and C3 the shortest cervical vertebra. In the lumbar region, average width exceeded average height of the vertebral bodies. Values for width and height did not differ significantly from L1 to L5; L3 was the longest and L5 the shortest lumbar vertebra.},

@article{huiskes1992relationship,
	Abstract = {Bone resorption around hip stems is a disturbing phenomenon, although its clinical significance and its eventual effects on replacement longevity are as yet uncertain. The relationship between implant flexibility and the extent of bone loss, frequently established in clinical patient series and animal experiments, does suggest that the changes in bone morphology are an effect of stress shielding and a subsequent adaptive remodeling process. This relationship was investigated using strain-adaptive bone-remodeling theory in combination with finite element models to simulate the bone remodeling process. The effects of stem material flexibility, bone flexibility, and bone reactivity on the process and its eventual outcome were studied. Stem flexibility was also related to proximal implant/bone interface stresses. The results sustain the hypothesis that the resorptive processes are an effect of bone adaptation to stress shielding. The effects of stem flexibility are confirmed by the simulation analysis. It was also established that individual differences in bone reactivity and mechanical bone quality (density and stiffness) may account for the individual variations found in patients and animal experiments. Flexible stems reduce stress shielding and bone resorption. However, they increase proximal interface stresses. Hence, the cure against bone resorption they represent may develop into increased loosening rates because of interface debonding and micromotion. The methods presented in this paper can be used to establish optimal stem-design characteristics or check the adequacy of designs in preclinical testing procedures.},

@article{Jones2007,
	Abstract = {This study aimed to establish model construction and configuration procedures for future vertebral finite element analysis by studying convergence, sensitivity, and accuracy behaviors of semiautomatically generated models and comparing the results with manually generated models. During a previous study, six porcine vertebral bodies were imaged using a microcomputed tomography scanner and tested in axial compression to establish their stiffness and failure strength. Finite element models were built using a manual meshing method. In this study, the experimental agreement of those models was compared with that of semiautomatically generated models of the same six vertebrae. Both manually and semiautomatically generated models were assigned gray-scale-based, element-specific material properties. The convergence of the semiautomatically generated models was analyzed for the complete models along with material property and architecture control cases. A sensitivity study was also undertaken to test the reaction of the models to changes in material property values, architecture, and boundary conditions. In control cases, the element-specific material properties reduce the convergence of the models in comparison to homogeneous models. However, the full vertebral models showed strong convergence characteristics. The sensitivity study revealed a significant reaction to changes in architecture, boundary conditions, and load position, while the sensitivity to changes in material property values was proportional. The semiautomatically generated models produced stiffness and strength predictions of similar accuracy to the manually generated models with much shorter image segmentation and meshing times. Semiautomatic methods can provide a more rapid alternative to manual mesh generation techniques and produce vertebral models of similar accuracy. The representation of the boundary conditions, load position, and surrounding environment is crucial to the accurate prediction of the vertebral response. At present, an element size of 2x2x2 mm(3) appears sufficient since the error at this size is dominated by factors, such as the load position, which will not be improved by increasing the mesh resolution. Higher resolution meshes may be appropriate in the future as models are made more sophisticated and computational processing time is reduced.},

The incidence of clinically diagnosed vertebral fractures was therefore directly assessed in the predominantly white (European descent) population of Rochester, Minnesota. Altogether, 341 Rochester residents were radiologically diagnosed for the first time with one or more vertebral fractures in the 5 year study period, 1985-1989. The overall age- and sex-adjusted incidence rate was 117 per 100,000 person-years (95{\%} CI, 105 to 130). The age-adjusted rate in women (145 per 100,000 person-years) was almost twice that in men (73 per 100,000 person-years). Of all fractures, 47 (14{\%}) followed severe trauma, 282 (83{\%}) followed moderate or no trauma, and 12 (3{\%}) were pathologic. Incidence rates for fractures following moderate trauma were higher in women than in men and rose steeply with age in both genders. In contrast, fractures following severe trauma were more frequent in men, and their incidence increased less with age. These Rochester rates are greater than those previously reported from studies in Britain and Sweden but lower than the incidence rates extrapolated from a prevalence study in this population.},

	Abstract = {The resultant hip joint force, its orientation and the moments were measured in two patients during walking and running using telemetering total hip prostheses. One patient underwent bilateral joint replacement and a second patient, additionally suffering from a neuropathic disease and atactic gait patterns, received one instrumented hip implant. The joint loading was observed over the first 30 and 18 months, respectively, following implantation. In the first patient the median peak forces increased with the walking speed from about 280{\%} of the patient's body weight (BW) at 1 km h−1 to approximately 480{\%} BW at 5 km h−1. Jogging and very fast walking both raised the forces to about 550{\%} BW; stumbling on one occasion caused magnitudes of 720{\%} BW. In the second patient median forces at 3 km h−1 were about 410{\%} BW and a force of 870{\%} BW was observed during stumbling. During all types of activities, the direction of the peak force in the frontal plane changed only slightly when the force magnitude was high. Perpendicular to the long femoral axis, the peak force acted predominantly from medial to lateral. The component from ventral to dorsal increased at higher force magnitudes. In one hip in the first patient and in the second patient the direction of large forces approximated the average anteversion of the natural femur. The torsional moments around the stem of the implant were 40.3 Nm in the first patient and 24 Nm in the second.},

	Abstract = {Background context: There are no published studies on the relationship between total disc replacement (TDR) motion and the development of adjacent level degeneration (ALD). Because prevention of ALD is the underlying justification for TDR, studies investigating the validity of this concept are essential. Purpose: To examine the relationship between range of motion (ROM) and ALD 8.7 years after lumbar TDR. Study design/setting: Retrospective radiographic and chart review. Patient sample: Forty-two patients 8.7 years after lumbar TDR. Outcome measures: Radiographic flexion-extension and ALD. Modified Stauffer-Coventry score. Oswestry Disability Questionnaire. Subjective patient ratings of back pain, leg pain, and disability. Methods: We reviewed the flexion-extension radiographs of 42 patients 8.7 years after TDR. Cephalad adjacent levels were evaluated for degeneration: loss of disc space height, anterior osteophyte formation, or dynamic flexion-extension instability. Graphical analysis of motion and the prevalence of ALD was performed. A statistical relationship between ALD and clinical outcome was sought. Results: Ten of 42 patients evaluated (24{\%}) had radiographic ALD. The mean motion was 3.8$\,^{\circ}$$\pm$2.0$\,^{\circ}$. The patients with ALD had mean motion of 1.6$\,^{\circ}$$\pm$1.3$\,^{\circ}$ whereas the patients without ALD had motion of 4.7$\,^{\circ}$$\pm$4.5$\,^{\circ}$ (p=.035). A clear relationship between motion and the presence of ALD at 8.7-year follow-up was observed. Patients with motion 5$\,^{\circ}$ or greater (n=13) had a 0{\%} prevalence of ALD. Patients with motion less than 5$\,^{\circ}$ (n=29) had a 34{\%} prevalence of ALD (p=.021, odds ratio 13.5). ALD had no statistically significant effect on clinical outcome although the sample size was small. Conclusions: At 8.7-year follow-up, the prevalence of ALD after TDR is higher in patients with motion less than 5$\,^{\circ}$. The presence of ALD had no significant effect on clinical outcome, but the sample size was small. These data suggest that patients with significant ROM after lumbar TDR may have reduced risk for radiographic ALD. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: We studied the incidence, prevalence, and radiographic progression of symptomatic adjacent-segment disease, which we defined as the development of new radiculopathy or myelopathy referable to a motion segment adjacent to the site of a previous anterior arthrodesis of the cervical spine. METHODS: A consecutive series of 374 patients who had a total of 409 anterior cervical arthrodeses for the treatment of cervical spondylosis with radiculopathy or myelopathy, or both, were followed for a maximum of twenty-one years after the operation. The annual incidence of symptomatic adjacent-segment disease was defined as the percentage of patients who had been disease-free at the start of a given year of follow-up in whom new disease developed during that year. The prevalence was defined as the percentage of all patients in whom symptomatic adjacent-segment disease developed within a given period of follow-up. The natural history of the disease was predicted with use of a Kaplan-Meier survivorship analysis. The hypothesis that new disease at an adjacent level is more likely to develop following a multilevel arthrodesis than it is following a single-level arthrodesis was tested with logistic regression. RESULTS: Symptomatic adjacent-segment disease occurred at a relatively constant incidence of 2.9 percent per year (range, 0.0 to 4.8 percent per year) during the ten years after the operation. Survivorship analysis predicted that 25.6 percent of the patients (95 percent confidence interval, 20 to 32 percent) who had an anterior cervical arthrodesis would have new disease at an adjacent level within ten years after the operation. There were highly significant differences among the motion segments with regard to the likelihood of symptomatic adjacent-segment disease (p{\textless}0.0001); the greatest risk was at the interspaces between the fifth and sixth and between the sixth and seventh cervical vertebrae. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found that the risk of new disease at an adjacent level was significantly lower following a multilevel arthrodesis than it was following a single-level arthrodesis (p{\textless}0.001). More than two-thirds of all patients in whom the new disease developed had failure of nonoperative management and needed additional operative procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Symptomatic adjacent-segment disease may affect more than one-fourth of all patients within ten years after an anterior cervical arthrodesis. A single-level arthrodesis involving the fifth or sixth cervical vertebra and preexisting radiographic evidence of degeneration at adjacent levels appear to be the greatest risk factors for new disease. Therefore, we believe that all degenerated segments causing radiculopathy or myelopathy should be included in an anterior cervical arthrodesis. Although our findings suggest that symptomatic adjacent-segment disease is the result of progressive spondylosis, patients should be informed of the substantial possibility that new disease will develop at an adjacent level over the long term.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: During total hip arthroplasty, use of a modular femoral neck on a stemmed implant allows optimization of neck anteversion, length, and offset, resulting in more accurate balance. We performed a retrospective analysis of a consecutive cohort of patients who had undergone total hip arthroplasty with a modular-neck hip system with ceramic-on-ceramic bearings.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We reviewed the results in fifteen patients who had received an ABG II dual modular hip system (Stryker Orthopaedics, Mahwah, New Jersey) from May 2007 to August 2008. Anteroposterior radiographs of the pelvis were reviewed and scored with regard to medial calcar erosion. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed to assess for adverse local tissue reaction around the hip joint. Calcar resorption was correlated with subsequent MRI findings. Retrieval analysis was performed on the implants removed at revision.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The mean duration of follow-up for all patients was 42.3 months (range, thirty-three to sixty months). Cobalt-ion levels were elevated in all patients; chromium levels were within the normal range. Medial femoral calcar erosion was noted in seven of the fifteen cases. All patients with grade-2 or 3 calcar erosion on radiographs had positive MRI findings consistent with adverse local tissue reaction. At the time of writing, seven patients had undergone revision arthroplasty. Intraoperatively, tissue staining with tissue and bone necrosis and pseudotumor formation were observed in all revision cases. Histological analysis confirmed the presence of metal-on-metal synovitis, with changes similar to those seen with metal-on-metal bearings.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The ABG II dual modular hip system is associated with a high rate of early failure secondary to fretting and corrosion at the femoral neck-stem taper. The component has subsequently been recalled and is no longer in use. Surgeons using modular hip systems with a titanium stem and cobalt-chromium neck should be vigilant about annual follow-up with radiographs, and use of MRIs as indicated.},

Seventy-nine 1-yr-old retired breeder Wistar rats were randomized into seven groups: 1) sham-operated, 2) OVX, 3) OVX plus estrogen, 4) OVX plus salmon calcitonin, 5) OVX plus human (h) PTH-(1-38), 6) OVX plus hPTH-(1-38) and estrogen, and finally, 7) OVX plus hPTH-(1-38) and calcitonin. Treatment regimens were initiated 8 weeks after ovariectomy and continued for 24 weeks. Whole body bone mass was measured by dual photon absorptiometry at intervals of 4 weeks and at death. Changes in spinal bone mass (BMC), biomechanical competence, and structure were assessed from the lumbar vertebral bodies. The results revealed a protective effect of both estrogen and calcitonin on ovariectomy-induced loss of whole body bone mass, but only estrogen had a significant effect on spinal BMC. hPTH-(1-38) monotherapy increased vertebral bone mass (BMC and ash content), size, and biomechanical parameters 20-80{\%} over OVX levels. A more rapid effect on vertebral bone mass was seen when hPTH-(1-38) was combined with estrogen or salmon calcitonin. The study has shown that in aged OVX osteopenic rats, hPTH-(1-38) therapy increases vertebral bone mass and bone quality and also maintains trabecular connectivity. Both estrogen and calcitonin reduce the ovariectomy-induced bone loss, but cannot restore bone mass to sham-operated levels. On the basis of this study, it is concluded that PTH therapy seems to hold promise in the management of postmenopausal and age-related osteoporosis.},

	Abstract = {Aseptic loosening and osteolysis are considered the main long-term problems of hip arthroplasty. Pathogenesis of periprosthetic osteolysis is multifactorial, and both the biological and mechanical factors seem to play an important role. Bearing surfaces continuously generate excessive amounts of micron and submicron particles provoking an adverse inflammatory response of periprosthetic connective tissues. In general, a key role has been attributed to macrophages. Cytokines, growth factors, PGE2, and enzymes are secreted with activated periprosthetic cells resulting in formation of osteolytic granulomas. The final osteolytic step is taken predominantly by osteoclasts which are getting ready for action mainly by an osteoprotegerin ligand (RANKL) and TNFalpha. Rankl is expressed by activated macrophages, osteoblasts, and lymphocytes. In parallel, a repetitive hydraulic effect of the joint fluid is manifested on the susceptible bone.},

	Abstract = {Porous titanium is a promising orthopedic implant material. As a potential use in total hip replacement, the effect of a porous titanium femoral prosthesis on bone remodeling is investigated in this paper. The stress and strain fields of a post-operative femur with a hip replacement are calculated by applying the three-dimensional finite element method. The effect of the implant material on the bone remodeling is evaluated by analyzing the loss of bone density following a strain magnitude based bone remodeling theory. Different implant materials, including currently used solid cobalt--chrome and solid titanium, potential porous titanium with different porosities, are considered in this study. This investigation confirms that bone loss around the implant strongly depends on the value of the elastic modulus of the prosthesis. There will be a sharp drop of the volume of the bone with density loss if a cobalt--chrome implant is replaced by a porous titanium implant. The numerical results show that both of the bone volume with density loss and the bone density loss rate decrease linearly with the increase of the porosity. However, increasing porosity will reduce the strength of porous titanium. With regard to material design for porous titanium-based femoral prosthesis, stress analysis is required to meet the strength requirement.},

	Abstract = {Vertebroplasty, which is the percutaneous injection of bone cement into vertebral bodies has recently been used to treat painful osteoporotic compression fractures. Early clinical results have been encouraging, but very little is known about the consequences of augmentation with cement for the adjacent, non-augmented level. We therefore measured the overall failure, strength and structural stiffness of paired osteoporotic two-vertebra functional spine units (FSUs). One FSU of each pair was augmented with polymethylmethacrylate bone cement in the caudal vertebra, while the other served as an untreated control. Compared with the controls, the ultimate failure load for FSUs treated by injection of cement was lower. The geometric mean treated/untreated ratio of failure load was 0.81, with 95{\%} confidence limits from 0.70 to 0.92, (p {\textless} 0.01). There was no significant difference in overall FSU stiffness. For treated FSUs, there was a trend towards lower failure loads with increased filling with cement (r2 = 0.262, p = 0.13). The current practice of maximum filling with cement to restore the stiffness and strength of a vertebral body may provoke fractures in adjacent, non-augmented vertebrae. Further investigation is required to determine an optimal protocol for augmentation.},

	Abstract = {The integrity of bone-cement interface is essential for the long-term stability of cemented total joint arthroplasty. Although several studies have been carried out on bone-cement interface at continuum level, micromechanics of the interface has been studied only recently for tensile and shear loading cases. Fundamental studies of bone-cement interface at microstructural level are critical to the understanding of the failure processes of the interface, where multiple factors may contribute to failure. Here we present a micromechanical study of bone-cement interface under compression, which utilised in situ mechanical testing, time-lapsed microcomputed tomography (CT) and finite element (FE) modelling. Bovine trabecular bone was used to interdigitate with bone cement to obtain bone-cement interface samples, which were tested in step-wise compression using a custom-made loading stage within the $\mu$CT chamber. A finite element model was built from the CT images of one of the tested samples and loaded similarly as in the experiment. The simulated stress-displacement response fell within the range of the experimental responses, and the predicted local strain distribution correlated well with the failure pattern in the subject-specific experimental model. Damage evolution with load in the samples was monitored both experimentally and numerically. The results from the FE simulations further revealed the development of damage in the regions of interest during compression, which may be useful towards a micromechanics understanding of the failure processes at bone-cement interface.},

	Abstract = {The inter-lamellar connectivity of the annulus fibrosus in the intervertebral disc has been shown to affect the prediction of the overall disc behaviour in computational models. Using a combined experimental and computational approach, the inter-lamellar mechanical behaviour of the disc annulus was investigated under conditions of radial loading.Twenty-seven specimens of anterior annulus fibrosus were dissected from 12 discs taken from four frozen ovine thoracolumbar spines. Specimens were grouped depending on their radial provenance within the annulus fibrosus. Standard tensile tests were performed. In addition, micro-tensile tests under microscopy were used to observe the displacement of the lamellae and inter-lamellar connections. Finite elements models matching the experimental protocols were developed with specimen-specific geometries and boundary conditions assuming a known lamellar behaviour. An optimisation process was used to derive the interface stiffness values for each group. The assumption of a linear cohesive interface was used to model the behaviour of the inter-lamellar connectivity.The interface stiffness values derived from the optimisation process were consistently higher than the corresponding lamellar values. The interface stiffness values of the outer annulus were from 43{\%} to 75{\%} higher than those of the inner annulus. Tangential stiffness values for the interface were from 6{\%} to 39{\%} higher than normal stiffness values within each group and similar to values reported by other investigators. These results reflect the intricate fibrous nature of the inter-lamellar connectivity and provide values for the representation of the inter-lamellar behaviour at a continuum level.},

	Abstract = {Recently published compression tests on PMMA/bone specimens extracted after vertebral bone augmentation indicated that PMMA/bone composites were not reinforced by the trabecular bone at all. In this study, the reasons for this unexpected behavior should be investigated by using non-linear micro-FE models. Six human vertebral bodies were augmented with either standard or low-modulus PMMA cement and scanned with a HR-pQCT system before and after augmentation. Six cylindrical PMMA/bone specimens were extracted from the augmented region, scanned with a micro-CT system and tested in compression. Four different micro-FE models were generated from these images which showed different bone tissue material behavior (with/without damage), interface behavior (perfect bonding, frictionless contact) and PMMA shrinkage due to polymerization. The non-linear stress-strain curves were compared between the different micro-FE models as well as to the compression tests of the PMMA/bone specimens. Micro-FE models with contact between bone and cement were 20{\%} more compliant compared to those with perfect bonding. PMMA shrinkage damaged the trabecular bone already before mechanical loading, which further reduced the initial stiffness by 24{\%}. Progressing bone damage during compression dominated the non-linear part of the stress-strain curves. The micro-FE models including bone damage and PMMA shrinkage were in good agreement with the compression tests. The results were similar with both cements. In conclusion, the PMMA/bone interface properties as well as the initial bone damage due to PMMA polymerization shrinkage clearly affected the stress-strain behavior of the composite and explained why trabecular bone did not contribute to the stiffness and strength of augmented bone. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

A series of quasistatic tensile and compressive mechanical tests were conducted using cement/bone composite structures machined from cement-infiltrated vertebral bodies. Experiments were performed both at room temperature and at body temperature. We found that the modulus of the composite structures was lower than bulk cement (p {\textless} 0.0001). For compression at 37 {\{}ring operator{\}} C: composite = 2.3 ?? 0.5 GPa, cement = 3.1 ?? 0.2 GPa; at 23 {\{}ring operator{\}} C: composite = 3.0 ?? 0.3 GPa, cement = 3.4 ?? 0.2 GPa. Specimens tested at room temperature were stiffer than those tested at body temperature (p = 0.0004). Yield and ultimate strength factors for the composite were all diminished (55-87{\%}) when compared to cement properties. In general, computational models have assumed that cement/bone composite had the same modulus as cement. The results of this study suggest that computational models of cement infiltrated vertebrae and cemented arthroplasties could be improved by specifying different material properties for cement and cement/bone composite. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Analysis of coordinates of the vertebral center provided quantitative data of the extension-to-flexion motion of each vertebra. In extension-to-flexion motion, the L4 vertebra showed a translation-predominant motion characteristic. The L5 vertebra had a rotation-predominant motion characteristic.

	Abstract = {UNLABELLED The purpose of the study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of balloon kyphoplasty compared to nonsurgical management and vertebroplasty for the treatment of hospitalised osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures in the UK. A cost-effectiveness model was constructed and used for analysis. Balloon kyphoplasty may be cost-effective compared to relevant alternatives. INTRODUCTION The objective of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) for the treatment of patients hospitalised with acute osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture (OVCF) compared to percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) and nonsurgical management (NSM) in the UK. METHODS A Markov simulation model was developed to evaluate treatment with BKP, NSM and PVP in patients with symptomatic OVCF. Data on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) with acute OVCF were derived from the FREE and VERTOS II randomised clinical trials (RCTs) and normalised to the NSM arm in the FREE trial. Estimated differences in mortality among the treatments and costs for NSM were obtained from the literature whereas procedure costs for BKP and PVP were obtained from three National Health Service hospitals. It was assumed that BKP and PVP reduced hospital length of stay by 6 days compared to NSM. RESULTS The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was estimated at Great Britain Pound Sterling (GBP) 2,706 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and GBP 15,982 per QALY compared to NSM and PVP, respectively. Sensitivity analysis showed that the cost-effectiveness of BKP vs. NSM was robust when mortality and HRQoL benefits with BKP were varied. The cost-effectiveness of BKP compared to PVP was particularly sensitive to changes in the mortality benefit. CONCLUSION BKP may be a cost-effective strategy for the treatment of patients hospitalised with acute OVCF in the UK compared to NSM and PVP. Additional RCT data on the benefits of BKP and PVP compared to simulated sham surgery and further data on the mortality benefits with BKP compared to NSM and PVP would reduce uncertainty.},

	Abstract = {We studied 100 consecutive patients with potentially unstable fractures and fracture-dislocations by multiplane computed tomography. The mechanism of failure of the middle osteoligamentous complex of the spine (posterior longitudinal ligament, posterior part of the vertebral body, and posterior annulus fibrosus) was determined by three-dimensional analysis. Three modes of middle-column failure were used to classify the injuries: axial compression (seventy-three patients), axial distraction (fifteen patients), and translation within the transverse plane (twelve patients). Fifty of eighty-six patients who were evaluated in the acute phase of injury underwent operative stabilization, and the mechanism of middle-column disruption determined the type of instrumentation that was used. Compression and distraction injuries of the middle complex could be appropriately treated by Harrington distraction and compression instrumentation, respectively. However, in translational injuries (torn posterior longitudinal ligament) routine Harrington instrumentation was contraindicated due to the risk of overdistraction. Translational injuries were associated with the greatest degree of instability and often had complete ligament discontinuity at the level of the affected vertebrae. Patients with a translational injury had the most severe neural deficits (six of eleven patients studied acutely having a complete spinal cord lesion). Translational injuries of the middle column were treated by segmental spinal instrumentation to provide strong fixation with minimum risk of neural sequelae from passing sublaminar wires. Moreover, postoperative use of a cast over insensate skin was not required. Computed tomography was more sensitive than any other modality in the diagnosis of disruption of the posterior elements in unstable burst fractures, and computer-reconstructed sagittal images were accurate in evaluating the nature of facet-joint failure in distraction injuries. Computed tomography with metrizamide proved superior to either conventional tomography or myelography alone in localizing the site of neural canal compromise in acute thoracolumbar injuries. The mode of failure of the middle osteoligamentous complex as visualized by computed tomography determined the pattern of spinal injury, the severity of the neural deficit, the degree of instability, and the type of instrumentation required.},

There is, however, a lack of basic data on the application, safety and biomechanical efficacy of materials such as polymethyl-methacrylate (PMMA) and calciumphospate (CaP) cements. The present study analyzed 33 vertebral pairs from five human cadaver spines. Thirty-nine vertebrae were osteoporotic (bone mineral density {\textless} 0.75 g/cm2), 27 showed nearly normal values. The cranial vertebra of each pair was augmented with either PMMA (Palacos E-Flow) or experimental brushite cement (EBC), with the caudal vertebra as a control. PMMA and EBC were easy to inject, and vertebral fillings of 20-50{\%} were achieved. The maximal possible filling was inversely correlated to the bone mineral density (BMD) values. Cement extrusion into the spinal canal was observed in 12{\%} of cases. All specimens were subjected to axial compression tests in a displacement-controlled mode. From load-displacement curves, the stiffness, S, and the maximal force before failure, Fmax, were determined. Compared with the native control vertebrae, a statistically significant increase in vertebral stiffness and Fmax was observed by the augmentation. With PMMA the stiffness increased by 174{\%} (P = 0.018) and Fmax by 195{\%} (P = 0.001); the corresponding augmentation with EBC was 120{\%} (P = 0.03) and 113{\%} (P = 0.002). The lower the initial BMD, the more pronounced was the augmentation effect. Both PMMA and EBC augmentation reliably and significantly raised the stiffness and maximal tolerable force until failure in osteoporotic vertebral bodies. In non-porotic specimens, no significant increase was achieved.},

	Abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Range of motion, neutral zone, and stiffness parameters of the complete cervical, thoracic, and lumbar sheep spine were determined in flexion and extension, axial left/right rotation, and right/left lateral bending. OBJECTIVES: To determine quantitative biomechanical properties of the sheep spine and compare them with those from the human spine. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Sheep spines often serve as a model for experimental in vivo and in vitro studies in spine research, but few quantitative biomechanical data from sheep spines for comparison with human specimens are available. METHODS: Complete spines were sectioned into single-joint segments and tested in a spine tester under pure moments in the three main anatomic planes. RESULTS: The craniocaudal variation in range of motion in all load directions was qualitatively similar between sheep spines and values reported in the literature for human specimens. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the biomechanical similarities of sheep and human spines demonstrated in this study, it appears that the use of the sheep spine, which already includes evaluation of surgical techniques and bone healing processes, might be extended to spinal implants.},

	Abstract = {The anatomy of baboon and human cervical spines were compared by measuring adult, cadaveric specimens.The objective of the study was to compare human and baboon cervical motion segments to determine whether the baboon provides a suitable model for spinal research.Several studies have examined the quantitative anatomy of the human cervical bones and ligaments. Several animal species have been used for cervical spine research; however, no studies have validated whether the animal models resemble the human cervical spine closely enough to provide generalizable data.Multiple morphologic parameters were measured directly from nine baboon and six human adult cadaveric cervical spine specimens. The bone structure and geometry of each of the seven cervical vertebrae were analyzed; the structure and histology of the ligaments were measured; and histomorphometry of the vertebrae was performed.The architectural composition and geometry of individual cervical vertebrae of baboons and humans were similar at each level. The proportional relationship of bone and ligament structures in the two species was almost identical. There were, however, several differences: 1) The baboon spine was about half the size of the human spine; 2) its vertebral arteries were encased fully within the C1 lateral mass; 3) its uncovertebral joints were more prominent; 4) its vertebral endplates were more concave; 5) its pedicles were thinner; 6) its transverse processes were longer; and 7) its spinous processes were horizontal and nonbifid.The geometry and anatomy of the baboon cervical spine closely resemble that of the human cervical spine. It therefore provides an excellent model for in vivo and in vitro research.},

@article{furtado2007biomechanical,
	Abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Cadaveric single vertebrae were used to evaluate vertebroplasty as a prophylactic treatment and as an intervention for vertebral compression fractures. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the biomechanical characteristics of prophylactic reinforcement and postfracture augmentation of cadaveric vertebrae. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Percutaneous vertebroplasty is a treatment option for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. Short-term results are promising, but longer-term studies have suggested a possible accelerated failure rate in the adjacent vertebral body. Limited research has been conducted into the effects of prophylactic vertebroplasty in osteoporotic vertebrae. This study aims to elucidate the biomechanical differences between the 2 treatment groups. METHODS: Human vertebrae were assigned to 2 scenarios: Scenario 1 simulated a wedge fracture followed by cement augmentation; Scenario 2 involved prophylactic augmentation using vertebroplasty. Micro-CT imaging was performed to assess the bone mineral density, vertebral dimensions, fracture pattern, and cement volume. All augmented specimens were then compressed under an eccentric flexion load to failure. RESULTS: Product of bone mineral density and endplate surface area gave a good prediction of failure strength when compared with actual failure strength of specimens in Scenario 1. Augmented vertebral bodies showed an average cement fill of 23.9{\%} +/- 8.07{\%}. There was a significant postvertebroplasty increase in failure strength by a factor of 1.72 and 1.38 in Scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. There was a significant reduction in stiffness following augmentation for Scenario 1 (t = 3.5, P = 0.005). Stiffness of the vertebral body in Scenario 2 was significantly greater than observed in Scenario 1 (t = 4.4, P = 0.0002). CONCLUSION: Results suggest that augmentation of the vertebrae postfracture significantly increases failure load, while stiffness is not restored. Prophylactic augmentation was seen to increase failure strength in comparison to the predicted failure load. Stiffness appears to be maintained suggesting that prophylactic vertebroplasty maintains stiffness better than vertebroplasty postfracture.},

	Abstract = {A retrospective study was performed to evaluate the radiographic changes that occurred at spinal levels adjacent to fused vertebrae after anterior cervical fusion. One hundred six patients with cervical spondylotic myeloradiculopathy (88 men, 18 women) were followed for an average of 8.5 years. The average age at follow-up was 64 years. Forty-two patients underwent a single-level fusion, 52 had a two-level fusion, and 12 had three levels fused. Seventeen patients who underwent additional surgery after anterior fusion also were reviewed, with an average follow-up period of 2.9 years. Postoperatively, cervical flexion-extension resulted in significantly increased movement about the vertebral interspace at the upper adjacent level. An increment of posterior slip of the vertebra immediately above the fusion level, with associated spinal canal compromise of less than 12 mm, significantly affected neurologic results. Patients with multilevel fusions notably exhibited these radiographic abnormalities at adjacent levels. Spinal canal stenosis, when associated with dynamic spinal canal stenosis in the vertebra above the fusion level, affected late neurologic results. Results of salvage laminoplasty were not satisfactory. Unnecessarily extended longer fusion must be avoided.},

@article{kang2009stress,
	Abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Segmental motion and bone-implant interface stresses were analyzed at C5-C6 levels with Bryan, Prestige LP, and ProDisc-C cervical disc prostheses using an image-based finite element modeling technique. OBJECTIVE: To predict stress patterns at the interface between prosthesis and lower vertebral end plate to better understand the underlying mechanisms of subsidence and how the load transfer pattern of each disc design affects segmental motion. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Subsidence is one of the most commonly reported device-related complications in intervertebral disc arthroplasty. Although clinical outcomes have been reported regarding many types of cervical prostheses, few reports have analyzed the effects of stress from cervical artificial discs to the vertebral end plate. METHODS: Three-dimensional voxel finite elements were built for C5-C6 spine unit based on computed tomography images acquired from a patient with indication for cervical disc arthroplasty. Models of facet joints and uncovertebral joints were added and artificial disc designs were placed in the intervertebral disc space. Static analyses were conducted under normal physiologic loads in flexion, extension, and lateral bending with precompression. RESULTS: Bryan disc recovered highest range of motion (4.75 degrees ) due to the high elastic nucleus, and therefore imposed the lowest stresses superior to C6. The ProDisc-C and Prestige LP discs caused high stress concentrations around their central fins or teeth, and may initiate bone absorption. Analysis of Prestige LP disc may indicate possible subsidence posteriorly caused by the rear-positioned metal-to-metal joint. CONCLUSION: Rigidity of the cores ("nuclei") in Prestige LP and ProDisc-C prostheses guarantee initial maintenance of disc height, but high contact stress takes place at the bone-end plate interface if they are improperly placed or undersized. Anchorage designs add an additional factor that may increase propensity of subsidence, indicated by the high contact stress occurring at the end plate flanges of Prestige LP, and at midline keel fixation on the end plate of ProDisc-C. Although Bryan disc differs in these 2 concerns, it also creates much larger displacement during motion with more variation in disc height that may theoretically increase the load sharing of facet and/or uncovertebral joints compared to more rigid artificial discs.},

	Abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Ex vivo biomechanical study using osteoporotic cadaveric vertebral bodies. OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between the volume of cement injected during percutaneous vertebroplasty and the restoration of strength and stiffness in osteoporotic vertebral bodies, two investigational cements were studied: Orthocomp (Orthovita, Malvern, PA) and Simplex 20 (Simplex P with 20{\%} by weight barium sulfate content; Stryker-Howmedica-Osteonics, Rutherford, NJ). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Previous biomechanical studies have shown that injections of 8-10 mL of cement during vertebroplasty restore or increase vertebral body strength and stiffness; however, the dose-response association between cement volume and restoration of strength and stiffness is unknown. METHODS: Compression fractures were experimentally created in 144 vertebral bodies (T6-L5) obtained from 12 osteoporotic spines harvested from female cadavers. After initial strength and stiffness were determined, the vertebral bodies were stabilized using bipedicular injections of cement totaling 2, 4, 6, or 8 mL and recompressed, after which post-treatment strength and stiffness were measured. Strength and stiffness were considered restored when post-treatment values were not significantly different from initial values. RESULTS: Strength was restored for all regions when 2 mL of either cement was injected. To restore stiffness with Orthocomp, the thoracic and thoracolumbar regions required 4 mL, but the lumbar region required 6 mL. To restore stiffness with Simplex 20, the thoracic and lumbar regions required 4 mL, but the thoracolumbar region required 8 mL. CONCLUSION: These data provide guidance on the cement volumes needed to restore biomechanical integrity to compressed osteoporotic vertebral bodies.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vertebral compression fractures are a significant cause of morbidity amongst the elderly, resulting in pain, kyphosis, decreased mobility, and often depression. The two most popular operative treatments of compression wedge fractures are vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, however, which method leads to restoration of normal spinal loading is unknown.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A cadaveric thoracolumbar spine model was fractured and then treated using one of two techniques: vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty. Three non-destructive loading regimes were applied to the intact, fractured and treated cases. Sub-adjacent nuclear pressure, used as a measure of anterior column loading, was determined for each experimental variant and loading case.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nFINDINGS: The data indicate that nuclear pressure was substantially reduced after the spine was fractured. These pressures were minimally increased after treatment, however, not to the level of the pre-fractured condition. In all loading cases, there were no significant differences between the two treatment types.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nINTERPRETATION: While our data show that both vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty allow the disc to generate higher nuclear pressures, neither treatment increased nucleus pulposus pressure above the level of the intact state. This directly relates to the clinical condition in that adjacent segment fractures sustained subsequent to either treatment is likely the result of overall disease progression, and not a direct result of the intervention.},

Questions/purposes: We evaluated functional outcomes with a revision modular system and determined whether such a system achieved initial distal fixation, femoral offset restoration, leg length equalization, and hip stability. Methods: We prospectively followed 118 patients in whom a modular stem system was used for reconstruction of their failed index femoral stem. Sixty-nine hips were classified as Type I (classification of Paprosky et al.), 35 as Type II, 17 as Type III, and one as Type IV. Functional assessment was achieved using patient-and physician-administered outcome evaluations (SF-36, WOMAC, Lower Extremity Activity Scale, Harris hip score). Stem fixation, offset restoration, leg length discrepancy, and hip stability were evaluated radiographically. Complications were also recorded. Minimum followup was 2 years (average, 4 years; range, 2-7 years). Results: Average values on all functional outcome evaluations showed improvement at latest followup. Distal bone ingrowth fixation was obtained in 100{\%} of the patients, offset was corrected in 66{\%}, leg length discrepancy was corrected in 78{\%}, and stability was achieved in 97{\%}. No failures or fractures at the body to stem junction were seen at latest followup. Conclusions: Modular femoral components achieved functional outcomes and were useful to address distal fixation, femoral offset restoration, leg length equalization, and hip stability when revising failed femoral components. Level of Evidence: Level IV, therapeutic study. See the Guidelines for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence. 2010 The Association of Bone and Joint Surgeons.},

	Abstract = {From a retrospective study of 412 thoracolumbar injuries, the author introduces the concept of middle column or middle osteoligamentous complex between the traditionally recognized posterior ligamentous complex and the anterior longitudinal ligament. This middle column is formed by the posterior wall of the vertebral body, the posterior longitudinal ligament and posterior annulus fibrosus. The third column appears crucial, as the mode of its failure correlates both with the type of spinal fracture and with its neurological injury. Spinal injuries were subdivided into minor and major. Minor injuries are represented by fractures of transverse processes, facets, pars interarticularis, and spinous process. Major spinal injuries are classified into four different categories: compression fractures, burst fractures, seat-belt-type injuries, and fracture dislocations. These four well-recognized injuries have been studied carefully in clinical terms as well as on roentgenograms and computerized axial tomograms. They were then subdivided into subtypes demonstrating the very wide spectrums of these four entities. The correlation between the three-column system, the classification, the stability, and the therapeutic indications are presented.},

	Abstract = {Cylindrical trabecular bone samples from the central part of the first lumbar vertebral body were obtained from 42 normal people (27 females and 15 males) aged 15-87 years and analyzed by a compression test in either vertical or horizontal direction. Maximum stress, maximum stiffness, energy absorption capacity, and strain at maximum stress (compressibility) were calculated from the load-deformation curves. The ash density of the samples was measured after incineration. From age 20 to 80 years, the decline (P less than 0.01) in ash density was 48-50{\%} compared to a 75-80{\%} decrease (P less than 0.001) in vertical stress, stiffness, and energy absorption capacity. Qualitatively similar age-related changes (P less than 0.01) were observed by horizontal compression, but the absolute values were smaller. In both directions, highly significant positive correlations (P less than 0.01) were observed between the biomechanical properties and ash density stress, stiffness and energy absorption capacity still showed significant decreases with age (P less than 0.01). The vertical maximum strain values, which increased (P less than 0.05) with age, were inversely related to the other biomechanical variables (P less than 0.05) and to the ash density (P less than 0.05). It is concluded from the study that the biomechanical competence of vertebral trabecular bone depends not only on bone mass (ash density) but also on the continuity of the trabecular lattice, which changes with increasing age.},

	Abstract = {Continuum finite element (FE) models are standard tools for determination of biomechanical properties of bones and bone-implant systems. This study investigates the accuracy of an enhanced continuum FE model by taking muFE as the gold standard. The enhanced continuum models account for trabecular bone morphology (density and fabric) as well as for an anatomically correct cortical shell. Vertebral body slice models are extracted from high-resolution CT images using an algorithm proposed in [Pahr and Zysset, 2008b. From high-resolution CT data to FE models: development of an integrated modular framework. Computer Methods in Biomechanics and Biomedical Engineering, in press.]. Three different models are generated: the proposed enhanced density-fabric-based model with a subject-specific cortex and two classical isotropic density-only models, with and without explicit modeling of the cortical shell. The material property errors of the used morphology-elasticity relationship are minimized by using elasticity tensors from 60 cubical muFE models which are cropped from the trabecular centrums of the investigated vertebral bodies. Two different boundary conditions-kinematic [Van Rietbergen et al., 1995. A new method to determine trabecular bone elastic properties and loading using micromechanical FE models. Journal of Biomechanics 28 (1), 69-81] and mixed [Pahr, D.H., Zysset, P.K., 2008a. Influence of boundary conditions on computed apparent elastic properties of cancellous bone. Biomechanics and Modeling in Mechanobiology 7, 463-476.]-are used in these FE models. After removal of the endplates, compressive and antero-posterior shear loading is applied on the investigated vertebral bodies. Individual error sources are studied in more detail by loading also the trabecular centrum (removed shell) and the cortical shell alone. It is found that the cortex-only models need a correction of the shell thickness when transforming from a voxel to a smooth description. The trabecular centrum alone gives too stiff and too soft a response using material calibration with kinematic and mixed boundary conditions, respectively. A comparison of the whole vertebral body stiffnesses shows that an orthotropic cancellous bone material calibrated with kinematic boundary conditions corresponds best with muFE. Taken together, the proposed enhanced homogenized surface-based FE model is structurally more accurate than density-only models.},

@article{Graham2003,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Osteopenia is one factor that may influence the decision about the type of implant fixation to use in total hip arthroplasty. However, clinical studies generally do not associate the outcome of an arthroplasty with the degree of osteopenia. The mechanical integrity of the cement fixation of an implant may be affected by the relative degree of osteopenia, which could account for some of the variable long-term results after total hip arthroplasty performed with cement. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of bone porosity, trabecular orientation, cement pressure, and cement penetration depth on fracture toughness at the bone-cement interface. METHODS: Trabecular bone from the proximal part of bovine femora was used with a single brand of commercial acrylic bone cement to form compact-tension interface specimens representing a range of bone porosities, orientations, and cement pressures within a clinically achievable range. All specimens were loaded to failure with use of a servohydraulic testing machine, and fracture toughness at the interface was calculated. After testing, images of a representative sample of specimens were made with use of computed tomography to measure the penetration depth of the cement into the bone. RESULTS: Significant correlations were found between fracture toughness and bone porosity, trabecular orientation, and cement pressure, with bone porosity having the strongest effect (p {\textless} 0.000015). Examination of the computed tomographic images also showed a significant correlation between fracture toughness and maximum cement penetration depth (p {\textless} 0.033), as well as significant partial correlations between maximum and mean penetration depth and bone porosity (p {\textless} 0.0037 and p {\textless} 0.0028). CONCLUSION: The fracture resistance of the bone-cement interface is greatly improved when the ability of the cement to flow into the intertrabecular spaces is enhanced.},

	Abstract = {The precise dimensions of the lumbar vertebrae and discs are critical for the production of appropriate spinal implants. Unfortunately, existing databases of vertebral and intervertebral dimensions are limited either in accuracy, study population or parameters recorded. The objective of this study is to provide a large and accurate database of lumbar spinal characteristics from 126 digitised computed tomographic (CT) images, reviewed using the Picture Archiving Communication System (PACS) coupled with its internal measuring instrumentation. These CT images were obtained from patients with low back pain attending the spinal clinic at the Hammersmith Hospitals NHS Trust. Measurements of various aspects of vertebral dimensions and geometry were recorded, including vertebral and intervertebral disc height. The results from this study indicated that the depth and width of the vertebral endplate increased from the third to the fifth lumbar vertebra. Anterior vertebral height remained the same from the third to the fifth vertebra, but the posterior vertebral height decreased. Mean disc height in the lower lumbar segments was 11.6 +/- 1.8 mm for the L3/4 disc, 11.3 +/- 2.1 mm for the L4/5, and 10.7 +/- 2.1 mm for the L5/S1 level. The average circumference of the lower endplate of the fourth lumbar vertebra was 141 mm and the average surface area was 1,492 mm2. An increasing pedicle width from a mean of 9.6 +/- 2.2 mm at L3 through to 16.2 +/- 2.8 mm at L5 was noted. A comprehensive database of vertebral and intervertebral dimensions was generated from 378 lumbar vertebrae from 126 patients measured with a precise digital technique. These results are invaluable in establishing an anthropometric model of the human lumbar spine, and provide useful data for anatomical research. In addition this is important information for the scientific planning of spinal surgery and for the design of spinal implants.},

On the other hand, metallic biomaterials with variable Young's modulus are required to satisfy the needs of both patients and surgeons, namely, low and high Young's moduli, respectively. In this paper, we have discussed effective methods to improve the static and dynamic strength while maintaining low Young's modulus for $\beta$-type titanium alloys used in biomedical applications. Then, the advantage of low Young's modulus of $\beta$-type titanium alloys in biomedical applications has been discussed from the perspective of inhibiting bone atrophy and enhancing bone remodeling. Further, we have discussed the development of $\beta$-type titanium alloys with a self-adjusting Young's modulus for use in removable implants.},

@article{thomsen2002zone,
	Abstract = {We have previously shown that there are pronounced age-related changes in human vertebral cancellous bone density and microarchitecture. However, the magnitude of these changes seemed to be dependent on zone location in the vertebral body-the central third vs. the areas adjacent to the endplates. The aim of the present study was, therefore, to investigate whether such zone-specific differences could be identified by static histomorphometric measures. The material comprised 48 individuals (24 women aged 19-97 years, and 24 men aged 23-95 years). Three of the women had a known fracture of the L-2. From each L-2, thick frontal sections of half of the vertebra were embedded undecalcified in methylmethacrylate, cut into 10-microm-thick sections, and stained with aniline blue. The sections were scanned into a computer, and classic static histomorphometry was performed on the images. The histomorphometry was performed on both the whole section and on the separate zones (central and sub-endplate zone). The results showed that trabecular bone volume, trabecular number, and connectivity density decreased significantly faster with age, whereas marrow space star volume increased significantly faster with age in the zones adjacent to the endplates than in the central zone. The other histomorphometric measures showed no zone specificity in relation to aging. However, trabecular thickness and trabecular separation were both higher at all ages in the central zone than in the sub-endplate zone, although this was significant only for trabecular separation. The described differences might have significant clinical implications concerning quantitative computed tomography (QCT) scanning, X-ray analyses, and assessment of fracture liability in the human spine, but the underlying pathogenesis is still not known. This study shows that the human vertebral body can be described as two distinct zones with very specific age-related changes in density and microstructure. This zone-specificity is important for the correct interpretation of clinical data.},

	Abstract = {Abstract 10.1359/jbmr.2002.17.4.716.abs Vertebral fracture is one of the major adverse clinical consequences of osteoporosis; however, there are few data concerning the incidence of vertebral fracture in population samples of men and women. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of vertebral fracture in European men and women. A total of 14,011 men and women aged 50 years and over were recruited from population-based registers in 29 European centers and had an interviewer-administered questionnaire and lateral spinal radiographs performed. The response rate for participation in the study was approximately 50{\%}. Repeat spinal radiographs were performed a mean of 3.8 years following the baseline film. All films were evaluated morphometrically. The definition of a morphometric fracture was a vertebra in which there was evidence of a 20{\%} (+4 mm) or more reduction in anterior, middle, or posterior vertebral height between films---plus the additional requirement that a vertebra satisfy criteria for a prevalent deformity (using the McCloskey-Kanis method) in the follow-up film. There were 3174 men, mean age 63.1 years, and 3614 women, mean age 62.2 years, with paired duplicate spinal radiographs (48{\%} of those originally recruited to the baseline survey). The age standardized incidence of morphometric fracture was 10.7/1000 person years (pyr) in women and 5.7/1000 pyr in men. The age-standardized incidence of vertebral fracture as assessed qualitatively by the radiologist was broadly similar---12.1/1000 pyr and 6.8/1000 pyr, respectively. The incidence increased markedly with age in both men and women. There was some evidence of geographic variation in fracture occurrence; rates were higher in Sweden than elsewhere in Europe. This is the first large population-based study to ascertain the incidence of vertebral fracture in men and women over 50 years of age across Europe. The data confirm the frequent occurrence of the disorder in men as well as in women and the rise in incidence with age.},

	Abstract = {The representation of cement-augmented bone in finite element (FE) models of vertebrae following vertebroplasty remains a challenge, and the methods of the model validation are limited. The aim of this study was to create specimen-specific FE models of cement-augmented synthetic bone at the microscopic level, and to develop a new methodology to validate these models. An open cell polyurethane foam was used reduce drying effects and because of its similar structure to osteoporotic trabecular bone. Cylindrical specimens of the foam were augmented with PMMA cement. Each specimen was loaded to three levels of compression inside a micro-computed tomography ($\mu$CT) scanner and imaged both before compression and in each of the loaded states. Micro-FE models were generated from the unloaded $\mu$CT images and displacements applied to match measurements taken from the images. A morphological comparison between the FE-predicted trabecular deformations and the corresponding experimental measurements was developed to validate the accuracy of the FE model. The predicted deformation was found to be accurate (less than 12{\%} error) in the elastic region. This method can now be used to evaluate real bone and different types of bone cements for different clinical situations.},

	Abstract = {The foreign body reaction composed of macrophages and foreign body giant cells is the end-stage response of the inflammatory and wound healing responses following implantation of a medical device, prosthesis, or biomaterial. A brief, focused overview of events leading to the foreign body reaction is presented. The major focus of this review is on factors that modulate the interaction of macrophages and foreign body giant cells on synthetic surfaces where the chemical, physical, and morphological characteristics of the synthetic surface are considered to play a role in modulating cellular events. These events in the foreign body reaction include protein adsorption, monocyte/macrophage adhesion, macrophage fusion to form foreign body giant cells, consequences of the foreign body response on biomaterials, and cross-talk between macrophages/foreign body giant cells and inflammatory/wound healing cells. Biomaterial surface properties play an important role in modulating the foreign body reaction in the first two to four weeks following implantation of a medical device, even though the foreign body reaction at the tissue/material interface is present for the in vivo lifetime of the medical device. An understanding of the foreign body reaction is important as the foreign body reaction may impact the biocompatibility (safety) of the medical device, prosthesis, or implanted biomaterial and may significantly impact short- and long-term tissue responses with tissue-engineered constructs containing proteins, cells, and other biological components for use in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Our perspective has been on the inflammatory and wound healing response to implanted materials, devices, and tissue-engineered constructs. The incorporation of biological components of allogeneic or xenogeneic origin as well as stem cells into tissue-engineered or regenerative approaches opens up a myriad of other challenges. An in depth understanding of how the immune system interacts with these cells and how biomaterials or tissue-engineered constructs influence these interactions may prove pivotal to the safety, biocompatibility, and function of the device or system under consideration. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The biomechanical behavior of total disc replacement (TDR) and anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) incomplex multiplanar motion is incompletely understood. The purpose of this study was to determine whether ACDF or TDR significantly affects in vitro kinematics through a range of complex, multiplanar motions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Seven human cervical spines from C4-7 were used for this study. Intact cervical motion segments with and without implanted TDR and ACDF were tested by use of unconstrained pure bending moment testing fixtures in 7 mechanical modes: axial rotation (AR); flexion/extension (FE); lateral bending (LB); combined FE and LB; combined FE and AR; combined LB and AR; and combined FE, LB, and AR. Statistical testing was performed to determine whether differences existed in range of motion (ROM) and stiffness among spinal segments and treatment groups for each mechanical test mode.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: ACDF specimens showed increased stiffness compared with the intact and TDR specimens (P {\textless} .001); stiffness was not found to be different between TDR and intact specimens. ACDF specimens showed decreased ROM in all directions compared with TDR and intact specimens at the treated level. For the coupled motion test, including AR, LB, and FE, the cranial adjacent level (C4/C5) for the intact specimens (2.7$\,^{\circ}$) showed significantly less motion compared with both the TDR (6.1$\,^{\circ}$, P = .009) and ACDF (6.8$\,^{\circ}$, P = .002) treatment groups about the LB axis. Testing of the C4/C5 and C6/C7 levels in all other test modes yielded no significant differences in ROM comparisons, although a trend toward increasing ROM in adjacent levels in ACDF specimens compared with intact and TDR specimens was observed.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: This study compared multiplanar motion under load-displacement testing of subaxial cervical motion segments with and without implanted TDR and ACDF. We found a trend toward increased motion in adjacent levels in ACDF specimens compared with TDR specimens. Biomechanical multiplanar motion testing will be useful in the ongoing development and evaluation of spinal motion-preserving implants.},

Clinicians practicing vertebroplasty commonly alter the mixture of monomer-to-powder recommended by the manufacturer in an effort to decrease viscosity and increase the working time. The purpose of the current study was to measure the effect of varying the monomer-to-powder ratio on the compressive material properties (compressive modulus, yield stress, and ultimate compressive strength) of the cement Simplex P (Stryker-Howmedica-Osteonics, Rutherford, NJ). Cylindrical specimens were prepared using monomer-to-powder ratios of 0.45 to 1.00 mL/g and tested in compression. Peak compressive material properties occurred at the mixture ratio recommended by the manufacturer (0.5 mL/g) but decreased as the ratio of monomer to powder was increased. The material properties of specimens cured for 1 hour were significantly less than those for specimens cured for 24 hours. The monomer-to-powder ratio affects the compressive material properties of cement. The clinical significance of these results with respect to vertebroplasty is yet to be determined.},

	Abstract = {In order to gain insight into the micro-mechanical behavior of the cement-bone interface, the effect of parametric variations of frictional, morphological and material properties on the mechanical response of the cement-bone interface were analyzed using a finite element approach. Finite element models of a cement-bone interface specimen were created from micro-computed tomography data of a physical specimen that was sectioned from an in vitro cemented total hip arthroplasty. In five models the friction coefficient was varied (??=0.0; 0.3; 0.7; 1.0 and 3.0), while in one model an ideally bonded interface was assumed. In two models cement interface gaps and an optimal cement penetration were simulated. Finally, the effect of bone cement stiffness variations was simulated (2.0 and 2.5 GPa, relative to the default 3.0 GPa). All models were loaded for a cycle of fully reversible tension-compression. From the simulated stress-displacement curves the interface deformation, stiffness and hysteresis were calculated. The results indicate that in the current model the mechanical properties of the cement-bone interface were caused by frictional phenomena at the shape-closed interlock rather than by adhesive properties of the cement. Our findings furthermore show that in our model maximizing cement penetration improved the micromechanical response of the cement-bone interface stiffness, while interface gaps had a detrimental effect. Relative to the frictional and morphological variations, variations in the cement stiffness had only a modest effect on the micro-mechanical behavior of the cement-bone interface. The current study provides information that may help to better understand the load-transfer mechanisms taking place at the cement-bone interface. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Concern over polyethylene wear particle induced aseptic loosening of metal-on-polyethylene hip prostheses has led to renewed interest in alternative materials such as metal-on-metal and alumina ceramic-on-alumina ceramic for total hip replacement. This study compared the effects of clinically relevant cobalt-chromium and alumina ceramic wear particles on the viability of U937 histiocytes and L929 fibroblasts in vitro. Clinically relevant cobalt-chromium wear particles were generated using a flat pin-on-plate tribometer. The mean size of the clinically relevant metal particles was 29.5??6.3 nm (range 5-200 nm). Clinically relevant alumina ceramic particles were generated in the Leeds MkII anatomical hip simulator from a Mittelmieier prosthesis using micro-separation motion. This produced particles with a bimodal size distribution. The majority (98{\%}) of the clinically relevant alumina ceramic wear debris was 5-20 nm in size. The cytotoxicity of the clinically relevant wear particles was compared to commercially available cobalt-chromium (9.87 ??m??5.67) and alumina ceramic (0.503??0.19 ??m) particles. The effects of the particles on the cells over a 5 day period at different particle volume (??m3) to cell number ratios were tested and viability determined using ATP-Lite???. Clinically relevant cobalt-chromium particles 50 and 5 ??m3 per cell reduced the viability of U937 cells by 97{\%} and 42{\%} and reduced the viability of L929 cells by 95{\%} and 73{\%}, respectively. At 50 ??m3 per cell, the clinically relevant ceramic particles reduced U937 cell viability by 18{\%}. None of the other concentrations of the clinically relevant particles were toxic. The commercial cobalt-chromium and alumina particles did not affect the viability of either the U937 histiocytes or the L929 fibroblasts. Thus at equivalent particle volumes the clinically relevant cobalt-chromium particles were more toxic then the alumina ceramic particles. This study has emphasised the fact that the nature, size and volume of particles are important in assessing biological effects of wear debris on cells in vitro. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

	Abstract = {Spinal burst fractures account for about 15{\%} of spinal injuries and, because of their predominance in the younger population, there are large associated social and healthcare costs. Although several experimental studies have investigated the burst fracture process, little work has been undertaken using computational methods. The aim of this study was to develop a finite element model of the fracture process and, in combination with experimental data, gain a better understanding of the fracture event and mechanism of injury. Experimental tests were undertaken to simulate the burst fracture process in a bovine spine model. After impact, each specimen was dissected and the severity of fracture assessed. Two of the specimens tested at the highest impact rate were also dynamically filmed during the impact. A finite element model, based on CT data of an experimental specimen, was constructed and appropriate high strain rate material properties assigned to each component. Dynamic validation was undertaken by comparison with high-speed video data of an experimental impact. The model was used to determine the mechanism of fracture and the postfracture impact of the bony fragment onto the spinal cord. The dissection of the experimental specimens showed burst fractures of increasing severity with increasing impact energy. The finite element model demonstrated that a high tensile strain region was generated in the posterior of the vertebral body due to the interaction of the articular processes. The region of highest strain corresponded well with the experimental specimens. A second simulation was used to analyse the fragment projection into the spinal canal following fracture. The results showed that the posterior longitudinal ligament became stretched and at higher energies the spinal cord and the dura mater were compressed by the fragment. These structures deformed to a maximum level before forcing the fragment back towards the vertebral body. The final position of the fragment did not therefore represent the maximum dynamic canal occlusion.},

	Abstract = {The sensitivity of vertebral body strength to the distribution of axial forces along the endplate has not been comprehensively evaluated. Using quantitative computed tomography-based finite element models of 13 vertebral bodies, an optimization analysis was performed to determine the endplate force distributions that minimized (lower bound) and maximized (upper bound) vertebral strength for a given set of externally applied axial compressive loads. Vertebral strength was also evaluated for three generic boundary conditions: uniform displacement, uniform force, and a nonuniform force distribution in which the interior of the endplate was loaded with a force that was 1.5 times greater than the periphery. Our results showed that the relative difference between the upper and lower bounds on vertebral strength was 14.2 +/- 7.0{\%} (mean +/- SD). While there was a weak trend for the magnitude of the strength bounds to be inversely proportional to bone mineral density (R2 = 0.32, p = 0.02), both upper and lower bound vertebral strength measures were well predicted by the strength response under uniform displacement loading conditions (R2 = 0.91 and R2 = 0.99, respectively). All three generic boundary conditions resulted in vertebral strength values that were statistically indistinguishable from the loading condition that resulted in an upper bound on strength. The results of this study indicate that the uncertainty in strength arising from the unknown condition of the disc is dependent on the condition of the bone (whether it is osteoporotic or normal). Although bone mineral density is not a good predictor of strength sensitivity, vertebral strength under generic boundary conditions, i.e., uniform displacement or force, was strongly correlated with the relative magnitude of the strength bounds. Thus, explicit disc modeling may not be necessary.},

@article{Heary2007,
	Abstract = {The most common site of injury to the spine is the thoracolumbar junction which is the mechanical transition junction between the rigid thoracic and the more flexible lumbar spine. The lumbar spine is another site which is more prone to injury. Absence of stabilizing articulations with the ribs, lordotic posture and more sagitally oriented facet joints are the most obvious explanations. Burst fractures of the spine account for 14{\%} of all spinal injuries. Though common, thoracolumbar and lumbar burst fractures present a number of important treatment challenges. There has been substantial controversy related to the indications for nonoperative or operative management of these fractures. Disagreement also exists regarding the choice of the surgical approach. A large number of thoracolumbar and lumbar fractures can be treated conservatively while some fractures require surgery. Selecting an appropriate surgical option requires an in-depth understanding of the different methods of decompression, stabilization and/or fusion. Anterior surgery has the advantage of the greatest degree of canal decompression and offers the benefit of limiting the number of motion segments fused. These advantages come at the added cost of increased time for the surgery and the related morbidity of the surgical approach. Posterior surgery enjoys the advantage of being more familiar to the operating surgeons and can be an effective approach. However, the limitations of this approach include inadequate decompression, recurrence of the deformity and implant failure. Though many of the principles are the same, the treatment of low lumbar burst fractures requires some additional consideration due to the difficulty of approaching this region anteriorly. Avoiding complications of these surgeries are another important aspect and can be achieved by following an algorithmic approach to patient assessment, proper radiological examination and precision in decision-making regarding management. A detailed understanding of the mechanism of injury and their unique biomechanical propensities following various forms of treatment can help the spinal surgeon manage such patients effectively and prevent devastating complications.},

To our knowledge there are no biomechanical studies evaluating multilevel cervical TDR.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Six human cadaveric cervical spine specimens (C3-C7, age: 57 +/- 12 years) were tested (i) intact, (ii) after TDR (Discover, DePuy, Raynham, MA) at C5-C6, and (iii) after additional TDR at C6-C7. Specimens were subjected to flexion/extension, lateral bending and axial rotation (+/-1.5 Nm). Segmental range of motion (ROM) was measured using optoelectronic instrumentation and fluoroscopy.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Insertion of TDR at C5-C6 increased flexion/extension ROM of the implanted segment compared with intact (8.6 +/- 1.0 vs. 12.3 +/- 3.3 degrees , P {\textless} 0.025). The TDR maintained ROM to intact levels in lateral bending (7.4 +/- 2.6 vs 6.0 +/- 1.6, P {\textgreater} 0.025) and axial rotation (5.5 +/- 1.9 vs. 6.0 +/- 2.9, P {\textgreater} 0.025). The TDR at C5-C6 did not affect ROM at the adjacent levels. Implantation of a second TDR at C6-C7 maintained the ROM at that segment to intact values in flexion/extension (9.6 +/- 4.3 vs. 11.2 +/- 5.5, P {\textgreater} 0.025), lateral bending (6.1 +/- 4.0 vs. 4.1 +/- 2.1, P {\textgreater} 0.025), and axial rotation (6.7 +/- 3.6 vs. 5.5 +/- 3.7, P {\textgreater} 0.025). The second TDR at C6-C7 did not affect the ROM of the prosthesis implanted at C5-C6. Two-level TDR at C5-C6-C7 did not affect the ROM at C4-C5 in flexion/extension or axial rotation, however, in lateral bending a small increase occurred (8.9 +/- 3.6 vs. 10.1 +/- 4.5, P {\textless} 0.025).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Cervical TDR at 2 levels can provide near-normal mobility at both levels without destabilizing the implanted segments or affecting adjacent segment motions. These observations lend support to the notion that single or multilevel cervical TDR may be advantageous when compared to fusion.},

	Abstract = {Classical finite element (FE) models can estimate vertebral stiffness and strength with much lower computational costs than muFE analyses, but the accuracy of these models rely on calibrated material properties that are not necessarily consistent with experimental results. In general, trabecular bone material properties are scaled with computer tomography (CT) density alone, without accounting for local variations in anisotropy or micro-architecture. Moreover, the cortex is often omitted or assigned with a constant thickness. In this work, voxel FE models, as well as surface-based homogenized FE models with topologically-conformed geometry and assigned with experimentally validated properties for bone, were developed from a series of 12 specimens tested up to failure. The effects of changing from a digital mesh to a smooth mesh, including a cortex of variable thickness and/or including heterogeneous trabecular fabric, were investigated. In each case, FE predictions of vertebral stiffness and strength were compared with the experimental gold-standard, and changes in elastic strain energy density and damage distributions were reported. The results showed that a smooth mesh effectively removed zones of artificial damage locations occurring in the ragged edges of the digital mesh. Adding an explicit cortex stiffened and strengthened the models, unloading the trabecular centrum while increasing the correlations to experimental stiffness and strength. Further addition of heterogeneous fabric improved the correlations to stiffness (R(2)=0.72) and strength (R(2)=0.89) and moved the damage locations closer to the vertebral endplates, following the local trabecular orientations. It was furthermore demonstrated that predictions of vertebral stiffness and strength of homogenized FE models with topologically-conformed cortical shell and heterogeneous trabecular fabric correlated well with experimental measurements, after assigning purely experimental data for bone without further calibration of material laws at the macroscale of bone. This study successfully demonstrated the limitations of current classical FE methods and provided valuable insights into the damage mechanisms of vertebral bodies.},

	Abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: The biomechanical behavior of a single lumbar vertebral body after various surgical treatments with acrylic vertebroplasty was parametrically studied using finite-element analysis. OBJECTIVES: To provide a theoretical framework for understanding and optimizing the biomechanics of vertebroplasty. Specifically, to investigate the effects of volume and distribution of bone cement on stiffness recovery of the vertebral body. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Vertebroplasty is a treatment that stabilizes a fractured vertebra by addition of bone cement. However, there is currently no information available on the optimal volume and distribution of the filler material in terms of stiffness recovery of the damaged vertebral body. METHODS: An experimentally calibrated, anatomically accurate finite-element model of an elderly L1 vertebral body was developed. Damage was simulated in each element based on empirical measurements in response to a uniform compressive load. After virtual vertebroplasty (bone cement filling range of 1-7 cm3) on the damaged model, the resulting compressive stiffness of the vertebral body was computed for various spatial distributions of the filling material and different loading conditions. RESULTS: Vertebral stiffness recovery after vertebroplasty was strongly influenced by the volume fraction of the implanted cement. Only a small amount of bone cement (14{\%} fill or 3.5 cm3) was necessary to restore stiffness of the damaged vertebral body to the predamaged value. Use of a 30{\%} fill increased stiffness by more than 50{\%} compared with the predamaged value. Whereas the unipedicular distributions exhibited a comparative stiffness to the bipedicular or posterolateral cases, it showed a medial-lateral bending motion ("toggle") toward the untreated side when a uniform compressive pressure load was applied. CONCLUSION: Only a small amount of bone cement ( approximately 15{\%} volume fraction) is needed to restore stiffness to predamage levels, and greater filling can result in substantial increase in stiffness well beyond the intact level. Such overfilling also renders the system more sensitive to the placement of the cement because asymmetric distributions with large fills can promote single-sided load transfer and thus toggle. These results suggest that large fill volumes may not be the most biomechanically optimal configuration, and an improvement might be achieved by use of lower cement volume with symmetric placement.},

The mode of the frequency distribution of the particles was in the range 0.1-0.5 mu m for all patients. However, analysis of the mass of wear debris as a function of its size allowed differentiation of the wear debris from different patients.

@article{Magerl1994,
	Abstract = {In view of the current level of knowledge and the numerous treatment possibilities, none of the existing classification systems of thoracic and lumbar injuries is completely satisfactory. As a result of more than a decade of consideration of the subject matter and a review of 1445 consecutive thoracolumbar injuries, a comprehensive classification of thoracic and lumbar injuries is proposed. The classification is primarily based on pathomorphological criteria. Categories are established according to the main mechanism of injury, pathomorphological uniformity, and in consideration of prognostic aspects regarding healing potential. The classification reflects a progressive scale of morphological damage by which the degree of instability is determined. The severity of the injury in terms of instability is expressed by its ranking within the classification system. A simple grid, the 3-3-3 scheme of the AO fracture classification, was used in grouping the injuries. This grid consists of three types: A, B, and C. Every type has three groups, each of which contains three subgroups with specifications. The types have a fundamental injury pattern which is determined by the three most important mechanisms acting on the spine: compression, distraction, and axial torque. Type A (vertebral body compression) focuses on injury patterns of the vertebral body. Type B injuries (anterior and posterior element injuries with distraction) are characterized by transverse disruption either anteriorly or posteriorly. Type C lesions (anterior and posterior element injuries with rotation) describe injury patterns resulting from axial torque. The latter are most often superimposed on either type A or type B lesions. Morphological criteria are predominantly used for further subdivision of the injuries. Severity progresses from type A through type C as well as within the types, groups, and further subdivisions. The 1445 cases were analyzed with regard to the level of the main injury, the frequency of types and groups, and the incidence of neurological deficit. Most injuries occurred around the thoracolumbar junction. The upper and lower end of the thoracolumbar spine and the T10 level were most infrequently injured. Type A fractures were found in 66.1{\%}, type B in 14.5{\%}, and type C in 19.4{\%} of the cases. Stable type A1 fractures accounted for 34.7{\%} of the total. Some injury patterns are typical for certain sections of the thoracolumbar spine and others for age groups. The neurological deficit, ranging from complete paraplegia to a single root lesion, was evaluated in 1212 cases.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We analyzed the natural course of conservatively treated osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures from VERTOS II, a randomized trial of vertebroplasty and conservative therapy in 202 patients with vertebral compression fractures. We assessed the proportion of patients who developed chronic back pain and possible risk factors.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMATERIALS AND METHODS: In VERTOS II, the VAS score was assessed at regular intervals until 1 year follow-up. We followed 95 conservatively treated patients until sufficient pain relief, defined as a VAS score ≤3. These patients were censured at the involved follow-up interval. In addition, baseline clinical and imaging data, and class of pain medication used in patients with a VAS score ≤3 at any follow-up interval were compared with those in patients with a VAS score {\textgreater}3 at every follow-up by using logistic regression analysis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: During 1 year of follow-up, 57 of 95 patients (60{\%}) had sufficient pain relief with VAS scores ≤3.

The follow-up revealed 10 patients with broken screws. BACKGROUND DATA: Retrospective examination of preoperative radiographs and computed tomographic axial and sagittal reconstruction images clearly demonstrated that the screw fractures all occurred in patients with a disproportionately greater amount of injury to the vertebral body. RESULTS: A point system (the load sharing classification) was developed that grades: 1) the amount of damaged vertebral body, 2) the spread of the fragments in the fracture site, and 3) the amount of corrected traumatic kyphosis. CONCLUSIONS: This point system can be used preoperatively to: 1) predict screw breakage when short segment, posteriorly placed pedicle screw implants are being used, 2) describe any spinal injury for retrospective studies, or 3) select spinal fractures for anterior reconstruction with strut graft, short-segment-type reconstruction.},

	Abstract = {Does "cement disease" exist? The bony environment surrounding a loosened cemented prosthesis is an abnormal pathologic condition which, if left unattended, will progress to a total failure of the joint including an inhibition of function and immobilizing pain. That biomaterial properties of the cement used for fixation also contribute to the pathologic state separates this disease from other modes of loosening. This leads inevitably to the conclusion that "cement disease" does exist. Methyl methacrylate has revolutionized the treatment of severe joint dysfunction. There can be no doubt that improving surgical technique, cement handling, and the cement itself will continue to improve the results and reduce the incidence of failure due to loosening. Cement is undoubtedly satisfactory for elderly patients with low activity levels and relatively short life expectancies. However, because of the inherent biologic and biomechanical properties of methyl methacrylate, it is unlikely that it can be rendered satisfactory in the long run for the young, the active, or the overweight patient, for whom alternatives are currently being sought. In such cases, the elimination of "cement disease" can only occur with the elimination of cement. Alternatives include the search for other grouting materials and the development of prostheses with satisfactory surfaces for either press-fit or biologic ingrowth.},

The model is next assessed through two examples. First, the simulation of a small piece of cardiac tissue is used to introduce the main features of the coupled model and calibrate its parameters against experimental evidence. Then, a more realistic prob- lem is solved using those parameters, with a mesh of the Oxford ventricular rabbit model.

	Abstract = {A broadening of the indications for which calcium phosphate cements (CPC) can be used, for example, in the field of vertebroplasty, would require injectable and higher strength materials. Unmodified CPC are not injectable due to a filter-pressing effect during injection. In this work we demonstrated that an effective method for improving the injection properties of CPC was by the use of sodium citrate solution as a liquid component. Cement consisting of tetracalcium phosphate (TTCP) and monetite (DCPA) mixed with water up to a powder:liquid ratio (P:L) of 3.3g/ml had an injectability of ∼60{\%}. The use of 500mm trisodium citrate solution instead of water decreased the viscosity of the cement paste to a point, where complete injectability ({\textgreater}95{\%}) through an 800$\mu$m diameter hypodermic needle could be achieved at low loads. The reduction in water demand of the cement effected by the use of sodium citrate enabled high P:L mixes to be formed which were 400{\%} stronger than cements made with water. The effect was less pronounced with compacted cements such that at 9MPa applied pressure, 58{\%} improvement was obtained and at 50MPa 36{\%} improvement was measured yielding a cement with a compressive strength of 154MPa. The liquefying effect of sodium citrate was thought to derive from a strong increase in the surface charge of both the reactants and the product as determined by zeta-potential measurement.},

	Abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: The issue of segmental stability using finite element analysis was studied. Effect of ligament and facet (total and partial) removal and their geometry on segment response were studied from the viewpoint of stability. OBJECTIVES: To predict factors that may be linked to the cause of rotational instabilities, spondylolisthesis, retrospondylolisthesis, and stenosis. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The study provides a comprehensive study on the role of facets and ligaments and their geometry in preserving segmental stability. No previous biomechanical study has explored these issues in detail. METHODS: Three-dimensional nonlinear finite element analysis was performed on L3-L4 motion segments, with and without posterior elements (ligaments and facets), subjected to sagittal moments. Effects of ligament and facet (partial and total) removal and their orientations on segment response are examined from the viewpoint of stability. RESULTS: Ligaments play an important role in resisting flexion rotation and posterior shear whereas facets are mainly responsible for preventing large extension rotation and anterior displacement. Facet loads and stresses are high under large extension and anterior shear loading. Unlike total facetectomy, selective removal of facets does not compromise segmental stability. Facet loads are dependent on spatial orientation. CONCLUSIONS: Rotational instability in flexion or posterior displacement (retrospondylolisthesis) is unlikely without prior damage of ligaments, whereas instability in extension rotation or forward displacement (spondylolisthesis) is unlikely before facet degeneration or removal. The facet stress and displacement distribution predicts that facet osteoarthritis or hypertrophy leading to spinal stenosis is most likely under flexion-anterior shear loading. Selective facetectomy may restore spinal canal size without compromising the stability of the segment. A facet that is more sagittally oriented may be linked to the cause of spondylolisthesis, whereas a less transversely oriented facet joint may be linked to rotational instabilities in extension.},

	Abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: In vitro investigation of cervical adjacent level intradiscal pressures (IDPs) following a total disc replacement arthroplasty. OBJECTIVES: The current in vitro study was undertaken to compare adjacent level IDPs and operative level kinematics following a cervical arthroplasty versus an arthrodesis procedure. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Clinical data indicate the incidence of symptomatic transition syndrome to be as high as 3{\%} annually following a cervical interbody arthrodesis. Recent developments in the motion preservation technology should, in theory, minimize transition syndrome at the adjacent levels. METHODS: A total of 10 human cadaveric cervical spines were used in this investigation. Following intact analysis, all specimens were sequentially reconstructed at C5-C6 with 1) total disc replacement (TDR), 2) allograft dowel, and 3) allograft dowel + anterior cervical plate. Testing was performed in displacement control under axial rotation, flexion/extension, and lateral bending loading modes. IDPs were recorded at C4-C5 and C6-C7 whereas peak range of motion (ROM) and NZ were monitored at C5-C6 level. RESULTS: Similar IDPs were recorded between the intact condition and a TDR reconstruction at both adjacent levels under all loading modes (P {\textgreater} 0.05). However, the C4-C5 IDP values produced under flexion/extension testing for both arthrodesis treatments were significantly higher than the means obtained for the intact and disc replacement groups (P {\textless} 0.05). Similar intergroup differences were observed at the C6-C7 level; however, statistical significance was achieved during all three loading methods (P {\textless} 0.05). C5-C6 ROM analysis indicated a significantly lower ROM for both arthrodesis constructs compared with intact and TDR groups during flexion/extension testing (P {\textless} 0.05). No differences were recorded between the intact and the total disc replacement group under any loading conditions (P {\textgreater} 0.05). CONCLUSION: This is a first study to document that a cervical disc replacement arthroplasty procedure maintains adjacent level IDPs and reconstruction level kinematics near the preoperative values. Consequently, total disc replacement may provide an alternative to conventional surgical management of cervical discogenic pathology decreasing the incidence of symptomatic transition syndrome.},

	Abstract = {We have evaluated if the cytotoxic effects of metals released from implants are due to necrosis or apoptosis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were exposed to different concentrations of chromium, nickel and cobalt extracts and the characteristics of both apoptosis and necrosis were evaluated by flow-cytometry at different culture endpoints. In order to define the prevalence of apoptosis or necrosis, the ratio cell death/apoptosis was calculated. A ratio of {\textless}/=1 means the prevalence of apoptotic events; a ratio {\textgreater}1 indicates the acute toxicity of the tested substance (necrosis). The extracts of chromium, cobalt and nickel had a cytotoxic effect on the mononuclear cells; high concentrations of cobalt and nickel produced cell necrosis, whereas by lowering the extract concentration apoptotic phenomena were observed. High chromium concentrations can induce cell death by apoptosis. Our data suggest that when large amounts of nickel and cobalt are released from implanted metal devices, necrosis is produced and consequently a strong inflammatory tissue reaction is likely to occur. The release of either chromium or limited amounts of nickel and cobalt induces toxicity characterized by apoptotic phenomena, which allows an adaptation of the tissue to the implant.},

Serial radiographs showed rapid bony integration of implants with evidence of bone apposition on the coating within six months. By Engh's criteria, all the femoral components had confirmed bone ongrowth after three years.

The primary outcomes were scores on the modified Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RDQ) (on a scale of 0 to 23, with higher scores indicating greater disability) and patients' ratings of average pain intensity during the preceding 24 hours at 1 month (on a scale of 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more severe pain). Patients were allowed to cross over to the other study group after 1 month.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: All patients underwent the assigned intervention (68 vertebroplasties and 63 simulated procedures). The baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups. At 1 month, there was no significant difference between the vertebroplasty group and the control group in either the RDQ score (difference, 0.7; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], -1.3 to 2.8; P=0.49) or the pain rating (difference, 0.7; 95{\%} CI, -0.3 to 1.7; P=0.19). Both groups had immediate improvement in disability and pain scores after the intervention. Although the two groups did not differ significantly on any secondary outcome measure at 1 month, there was a trend toward a higher rate of clinically meaningful improvement in pain (a 30{\%} decrease from baseline) in the vertebroplasty group (64{\%} vs. 48{\%}, P=0.06). At 3 months, there was a higher crossover rate in the control group than in the vertebroplasty group (51{\%} vs. 13{\%}, P{\textless}0.001) [corrected]. There was one serious adverse event in each group.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Improvements in pain and pain-related disability associated with osteoporotic compression fractures in patients treated with vertebroplasty were similar to the improvements in a control group.

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study compared porcine and human thoracic spine anatomies for a better understanding of how structures encountered during thoracoscopy differ between training with a porcine model and actual surgery in humans. METHODS: Parameters were measured including vertebral body height, width, and depth; disc height; rib spacing; spinal canal depth and width; and pedicle height and width. RESULTS: Although most porcine vertebral structures were smaller, porcine pedicle height was significantly greater than that of humans because the porcine pedicle houses a unique transverse foramen. The longus colli and psoas attach, respectively, to T5 and T13 in swine and to T3 and T12 in humans. In swine, the azygos vein generally was absent. The intercostal veins drained into the hemiazygos vein. CONCLUSIONS: Several thoracoscopically relevant anatomic differences between human and porcine spinal anatomies were identified. A thoracoscopic approach in a porcine model probably is best performed from the right side. The best general working area is between T6 and T10.},

	Abstract = {The aim of this work was to add to the body of data on the frequency and severity of degenerative radiographic findings at adjacent levels after anterior cervical interbody fusion and on their clinical impact and to contribute to the insights about their pathogenesis. One hundred eighty patients who were treated by anterior cervical interbody fusion and who had a follow-up of {\textgreater}60 months were clinically and radiologically examined by independent investigators. For all patients, the long-term Odom score was compared with the score as obtained 6 weeks after surgery. For myelopathic cases, both the late Nurick and the Odom score were compared with the initial postoperative situation. For the adjacent disc levels, a radiologic "degeneration score" was defined and assessed both initially and at long-term follow-up. At late follow-up after anterior cervical interbody fusion, additional radiologic degeneration at the adjacent disc levels was found in 92{\%} of the cases, often reflecting a clinical deterioration. The severity of this additional degeneration correlated with the time interval since surgery. The similarity of progression to degeneration between younger trauma patients and older nontrauma patients suggests that both the biomechanical impact of the interbody fusion and the natural progression of pre-existing degenerative disease act as triggering factors for adjacent level degeneration},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND CONTEXT: In vitro nondestructive flexibility testing of the CerviCore total disc replacement (TDR) was performed. It was hypothesized that TDR would not significantly alter biomechanics relative to intact, whereas rigid fixation would cause significant changes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPURPOSE: To assess the ability of a cervical metal-on-metal saddle-shaped TDR to replicate normal biomechanics in vitro.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSTUDY DESIGN: Human cadaveric flexibility experiment.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Nine human cadaveric C3-T1 specimens were tested intact, after TDR and after anterior plating. Flexion, extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation were induced by pure moments; flexion-extension was then repeated using a simplified muscle force model with 70-N follower load. Optical markers measured three-dimensional intervertebral motion, and eight points of laminar surface strain were recorded near the left and right C5-C6 facet joints. Biomechanical parameters studied included range of motion (ROM), lax zone (LZ), angular coupling pattern, sagittal instantaneous axis of rotation (IAR), and facet loads normal to the facet joint plane. Mean values of parameters were compared statistically using repeated measures analysis of variance and Holm-Sidak tests.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Total disc replacement caused significant reduction in ROM during extension (p=.004) and significant reduction in LZ during lateral bending (p=.01). However, plating significantly reduced both ROM and LZ during flexion, extension, and lateral bending (p{\textless}.006). Sagittal IAR shifted relative to intact by 3.6 mm after TDR (p{\textgreater}.05) and 6.5 mm after plating (p{\textgreater}.05). Coupled axial rotation/degree lateral bending was 99{\%} of intact after TDR but 76{\%} of intact after plating (p=.15). Coupled lateral bending/degree axial rotation was 95{\%} of intact after TDR but 85{\%} of intact after plating (p=.43). Neither construct altered facet loads from intact.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: With regard to ROM, LZ, IAR, and coupling, deviations from intact biomechanics were less substantial after TDR than after plating. Facet load alterations were minimal with either construct. Our results show that this particular TDR permits ROM and maintains some measures of kinematics in a cadaver model.},

	Abstract = {Aseptic loosening of total joint replacements is believed to be initiated by a macrophage response to prosthetic wear debris. To better characterize the early response to clinically relevant wear debris, we challenged primary human macrophages from four donors with ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE), TiAlV, CoCr, and alumina particles. After a 24-h culture, protein arrays were used to quantify the secretion of 30 different cytokines and chemokines. Macrophages secreted detectable levels of nine mediators in culture: Interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1beta, MCP-1, IL-8, IL-6, GM-CSF, IL-10, and IL-12p40. TiAlV particles were the most stimulatory, causing 5- to 900-fold higher cytokine expression compared with nonstimulated cells and uniquely eliciting high levels of IL-1alpha, IL-6, IL-10, and GM-CSF. CoCr and alumina were mildly stimulatory and typically elicited two- to fivefold greater levels than nonstimulated cells. Surprisingly, UHMWPE did not elicit a significant increase in cytokine release. Our data suggests that IL-1alpha, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and MCP-1 are the primary initiators of osteolysis and implicates metallic debris as an important trigger for their release.},

	Abstract = {The study aim was to develop and apply an experimental technique to determine the biomechanical effect of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and calcium phosphate (CaP) cement on the stiffness and strength of augmented vertebrae following traumatic fracture. Twelve burst type fractures were generated in porcine three-vertebra segments. The specimens were randomly split into two groups (n=6), imaged using microCT and tested under axial loading. The two groups of fractured specimens underwent a vertebroplasty procedure, one group was augmented with CaP cement designed and developed at Queen's University Belfast. The other group was augmented with PMMA cement (WHW Plastics, Hull, UK). The specimens were imaged and re-tested . An intact single vertebra specimen group (n=12) was also imaged and tested under axial loading. A significant decrease (p{\textless}0.01) was found between the stiffness of the fractured and intact groups, demonstrating that the fractures generated were sufficiently severe, to adversely affect mechanical behaviour. Significant increase (p{\textless}0.01) in failure load was found for the specimen group augmented with the PMMA cement compared to the pre-augmentation group, conversely, no significant increase (p{\textless}0.01) was found in the failure load of the specimens augmented with CaP cement, this is attributed to the significantly (p{\textless}0.05) lower volume of CaP cement that was successfully injected into the fracture, compared to the PMMA cement. The effect of the percentage of cement fracture fill, cement modulus on the specimen stiffness and ultimate failure load could be investigated further by using the methods developed within this study to test a more injectable CaP cement.},

	Abstract = {Vertebral fracture prevalence was assessed in an age-stratified random sample of Rochester, Minnesota women aged 50 years and over. Vertebral fractures, including wedge and concavity as well as compression fractures, were common and increased with age. The estimated incidence of new vertebral fractures also rose with age, reaching 29.6 per 1,000 person-years in women aged greater than or equal to 85 years. The prevalence of one or more vertebral fractures also increased with declining bone mass, reaching 42{\%} in women with spinal bone mineral density less than 0.6 g/cm2 by dual photon absorptiometry. Bone mass and age contributed independently to the risk of vertebral fracture, but "age" may reflect other manifestations of osteoporosis.},

	Abstract = {The immune system modulates many key biological processes in humans. However, the exact role of the immune system in particle-associated periprosthetic osteolysis is controversial. Human tissue retrieval studies, in vivo and in vitro experiments suggest that the immune response to polymer particles is non-specific and macrophage-mediated. Lymphocytes may modulate this response. However direct lymphocyte activation by polymer particle-protein complexes seems unlikely. However, metallic byproducts may complex with serum proteins and lead to a Type IV, lymphocyte-mediated immune reaction. In predisposed individuals, this reaction may rarely lead to persistent painful joint effusions, necessitating debridement and excision of the bearing surfaces of the prosthesis. In these patients, retrieved periprosthetic tissues exhibit histological evidence of perivascular lymphocytic cuffing. These findings are worrisome, given the fact that increasing numbers of metal-on-metal joint implants are being implanted in younger more active individuals worldwide. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

	Abstract = {Vertebral fractures may result in pain, loss of height, spinal instability, kyphotic deformity and ultimately increased morbidity. Fracture risk can be estimated by vertebral bone mineral density (BMD). However, vertebral fractures may be better defined by more selective methods that account for micro-architecture. Our aim was to quantify regional variations in bone architecture parameters (BAPs) and to assess the degree with which regional variations in BAPs affect vertebral fracture strength. The influence of disc health and endplate thickness on fracture strength was also determined. The soft tissue and posterior elements of 20 human functional spine units (FSU) were removed (T9 to L5, mean 74.45 ?? 4.25??years). After micro-CT scanning of the entire FSU, the strength of the specimens was determined using a materials testing system. Specimens were loaded in compression to failure. BAPs were assessed for 10 regions of the vertebral cancellous bone. Disc health (glycosaminoglycan content of the nucleus pulposus) was determined using the degree of binding with Alcian Blue. Vertebrae were not morphologically homogeneous. Posterior regions of the vertebrae had greater bone volume, more connections, reduced trabecular separation and more plate-like isotropic structures than their corresponding anterior regions. Significant heterogeneity also exists between posterior superior and inferior regions (BV/TV: posterior superior 12.6 ?? 2.8{\%}, inferior 14.6 ?? 3{\%}; anterior superior 10.5 ?? 2.2{\%}, inferior 10.7 ?? 2.4{\%}). Of the two endplates that abutted a common disc, the cranial inferior endplate was thicker (0.44 ?? 0.15??mm) than the caudal superior endplate (0.37 ?? 0.13??mm). Our study found good correlations between BV/TV, connective density and yield strength. Fracture risk prediction, using BV/TV multiplied by the cross sectional area of the endplate, can be improved through regional analysis of the underlying cancellous bone of the endplate of interest (R2 0.78) rather than analysis of the entire vertebra (R2 0.65) or BMD (R2 0.47). Degenerated discs lack a defined nucleus. A negative linear relationship between disc health and vertebral strength (R2 0.70) was observed, likely due to a shift in loading from the weaker anterior vertebral region to the stronger posterior region and cortical shell. Our results show the importance of considering regional variations in cancellous BAPs and disc health when assessing fracture risk. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study of 10 patients to measure the serum levels of cobalt and chromium after TDA. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the release of cobalt and chromium ions into the serum following implantation of the metal-on-metal Maverick-type artificial lumbar disc. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: In total hip endoprosthetics and consequently for TDA (total disc arthroplasty), metal-on-metal combinations are used with the aim of reducing wear debris. In metal-on-metal TDA the release of metal ions has until now been secondary to the main discussion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the serum cobalt and chromium concentration following implantation of 15 Maverick TDAs (monosegmental L5-S1, n = 5; bisegmental L4-L5 and L5-S1, n = 5; average age, 36.5 years). Five healthy subjects (no metal implants) acted as a control group. The measurements of the metals were carried out using the HITACHI Z-8200 AAS polarized Zeeman atomic absorption spectrometer after an average of 14.8 months. RESULTS: The concentrations of cobalt and chromium ions in the serum amounted on average to 4.75 microg/L (SD, 2.71) for cobalt and 1.10 microg/L (SD, 1.24) for chromium. Compared with control group, both the chromium and cobalt levels in the serum showed significant increases (Mann-Whitney U test, P = 0.0120). At follow-up,the Oswestry Disability Score was on average significantly decreased by 24.4 points (L5-S1) (t test, P {\textless} 0.05) and by 26.8 points (L4-S1) (t test, P {\textless} 0.05). The improved clinical situation is also represented by a significant decrease of the Visual Analog Pain Scale of 42.2 points after the follow-up (t test, P {\textless} 0.05). CONCLUSION: Significant systemic release of Cr/Co was proven in the serum compared with the control group. The concentrations of Cr/Co measured in the serum are similar in terms of their level to the values measured in THA metal-on-metal combinations or exceed these values given in the literature. Long-term implication of this metal exposure is unknown and should be studied further.},

The purpose of this study was to compare the vertical ground reaction forces of a group of 27 individuals who have undergone hip arthroplasty with a group of 35 normal control subjects. Specific force measures were determined from vertical ground reaction forces collected on a treadmill instrumented with two force plates. Symmetry indices were calculated on both groups of subjects. First and second peak forces, loading rate, impulse, and stance time were significantly less, while time to first peak force was significantly greater on the affected leg of the hip arthroplasty subjects when compared to their unaffected leg, or to the control group. The hip arthroplasty group showed greater asymmetry of ground reaction forces than the control group did. Bilateral asymmetric limb loading persists well after unilateral hip replacement surgery. Ground reaction force measures have been shown to be an effective means of quantifying the antalgic gait of hip arthroplasty patients.},

@article{raj2008intervertebral,
	Abstract = {This review article describes anatomy, physiology, pathophysiology and treatment of intervertebral disc. The intervertebral discs lie between the vertebral bodies, linking them together. The components of the disc are nucleus pulposus, annulus fibrosus and cartilagenous end-plates. The blood supply to the disc is only to the cartilagenous end-plates. The nerve supply is basically through the sinovertebral nerve. Biochemically, the important constituents of the disc are collagen fibers, elastin fibers and aggrecan. As the disc ages, degeneration occurs, osmotic pressure is lost in the nucleus, dehydration occurs, and the disc loses its height. During these changes, nociceptive nuclear material tracks and leaks through the outer rim of the annulus. This is the main source of discogenic pain. While this is occurring, the degenerative disc, having lost its height, effects the structures close by, such as ligamentum flavum, facet joints, and the shape of the neural foramina. This is the main cause of spinal stenosis and radicular pain due to the disc degeneration in the aged populations. Diagnosis is done by a strict protocol and treatment options are described in this review. The rationale for new therapies are to substitute the biochemical constituents, or augment nucleus pulposus or regenerate cartilaginous end-plate or finally artificial disc implantation..},

	Abstract = {Study Design. The quantitative anatomic, radio-graphic, computerized tomographic, and biomechanical data of sheep and human cervical spines were evaluated. Objectives. To compare the anatomic, radiographic, computerized tomographic, and biomechanical data of human and sheep cervical spines to determine whether the sheep spine is a suitable model for human spine research. Summary of Background Data. Sheep spines have been used in several in vivo and in vitro experiments. Quantitative data of the normal sheep cervical spine are lacking, yet these data are crucial to discussion about the results of such animal studies. Methods. In this study, 20 fresh adult female Merino sheep cervical spines and 20 fresh human cadaver cervi-cal spines were evaluated anatomically, radiographically, computerized tomographically, and biomechanically. Three linear and two angular parameters were evaluated on four digital radiographic views: anteroposterior, right lateral in neutral position, flexion, and extension. Quanti-tative computed tomography scans at the center of each vertebral body and 3 mm below both endplates were analyzed for bone mineral density measurements. Biome-chanical testing was performed in flexion, extension, ax-ial rotation, and lateral bending by a nondestructive stiff-ness method using a nonconstrained testing apparatus. Range of motion and stiffness of each motion segment were calculated. Additionally, 10 linear anatomic parameters of each vertebra were measured using a digital ruler. Results. Anterior and mean disc space height in the sheep cervical spine increased constantly from C2--C3 to C6 --C7, whereas middle disc space height decreased and posterior disc space height remained unchanged. Ante-rior and mean disc space height were significantly higher in sheep. In both sheep and human cervical spines, inter-vertebral angles were not significantly different. Standard deviations of bone mineral density in the human cervical spine were fourfold higher than in the sheep cervical spine, yet no significant differences were found in bone mineral density values between the two species. Range of motion differed significantly between the two species ex-cept in flexion-- extension of C3--C4, C5--C6, axial rotation of C2--C3, and lateral bending of C2--C3, C3--C4, and C4 -- C5. Stiffness also was significantly different except in flex-ion-- extension of C2--C3, C4 --C5, C5--C6, and lateral bend-ing of C2--C3, C3--C4, and C4 --C5. Anatomic evaluation showed no difference in upper endplate parameters for C4 and C5. Conclusions. Although several differences were found between human and sheep cervical spines, the small in-tergroup standard deviations and the good comparability with the human spine encourage the use of the sheep cervical spine as a model for cervical spine research. On the basis of the quantitative data obtained in this study, the sheep motion segment C3--C4 seemed to be the most reliable model for the corresponding human motion segment.

Animal specimens are more eas-ily available and show much better homogeneity than human specimens when selected for breed, gender, age, and weight. 7,8,12 Therefore, animals are becoming more and more common as in vivo and in vitro models for the human spine. Besides goat, pig, dog, and calf spines, most studies in the past have been carried out with sheep spines. The sheep cervical spine is stated to be a good model for the human cervical spine, mainly because of the comparable cervical lordosis.

As reviewers we are periodically called to evaluate manuscripts in which re- sults obtained from numerical models are used to draw clinically relevant recommendations. Some reviewers tend to consider physical and numerical models of equal value, arguing that both are a simplified representation of the problem being considered. Others consider all results obtained form a numerical model inherently false, and thus discourage any clinical recommendation based on these methods. Most reviewers look for a middle ground between these two extreme positions. In our opinion this disparity of opinions indicates a lack of con- sensus within our community. The aim of this editorial is to summarise the results of a wide discussion among ex- perts, and to delineate the position of the Editorial Board of Clinical Biomechanics on this important matter.},

	Abstract = {The deterioration of cancellous bone structure due to aging and disease is characterized by a conversion from plate elements to rod elements. Consequently the terms "rod-like" and "plate-like" are frequently used for a subjective classification of cancellous bone. In this work a new morphometric parameter called Structure Model Index (SMI) is introduced, which makes it possible to quantify the characteristic form of a three-dimensionally described structure in terms of the amount of plates and rod composing the structure. The SMI is calculated by means of three-dimensional image analysis based on a differential analysis of the triangulated bone surface. For an ideal plate and rod structure the SMI value is 0 and 3, respectively, independent of the physical dimensions. For a structure with both plates and rods of equal thickness the value lies between 0 and 3, depending on the volume ratio of rods and plates. The SMI parameter is evaluated by examining bone biopsies from different skeletal sites. The bone samples were measured three-dimensionally with a micro-CT system. Samples with the same volume density but varying trabecular architecture can uniquely be characterized with the SMI. Furthermore the SMI values were found to correspond well with the perceived structure type.},

	Abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: The biomechanics of vertebral bodies augmented with real distributions of cement were investigated using nonlinear finite element (FE) analysis. OBJECTIVES: To compare stiffness, strength, and stress transfer of augmented versus nonaugmented osteoporotic vertebral bodies under compressive loading. Specifically, to examine how cement distribution, volume, and compliance affect these biomechanical variables. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Previous FE studies suggested that vertebroplasty might alter vertebral stress transfer, leading to adjacent vertebral failure. However, no FE study so far accounted for real cement distributions and bone damage accumulation. METHODS: Twelve vertebral bodies scanned with high-resolution pQCT and tested in compression were augmented with various volumes of cements and scanned again. Nonaugmented and augmented pQCT datasets were converted to FE models, with bone properties modeled with an elastic, plastic and damage constitutive law that was previously calibrated for the nonaugmented models. The cement-bone composite was modeled with a rule of mixture. The nonaugmented and augmented FE models were subjected to compression and their stiffness, strength, and stress map calculated for different cement compliances. RESULTS: Cement distribution dominated the stiffening and strengthening effects of augmentation. Models with cement connecting either the superior or inferior endplate (S/I fillings) were only up to 2 times stiffer than the nonaugmented models with minimal strengthening, whereas those with cement connecting both endplates (S + I fillings) were 1 to 8 times stiffer and 1 to 12 times stronger. Stress increases above and below the cement, which was higher for the S + I cases and was significantly reduced by increasing cement compliance. CONCLUSION: The developed FE approach, which accounts for real cement distributions and bone damage accumulation, provides a refined insight into the mechanics of augmented vertebral bodies. In particular, augmentation with compliant cement bridging both endplates would reduce stress transfer while providing sufficient strengthening.},

	Abstract = {The use of high resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) and in vivo micro-CT for studies of bone disease and treatment has become increasingly common, and with these methods comes large quantities of data requiring analysis. A simple, robust, and fully-automated segmentation algorithm is presented that efficiently segments bone regions. The dual threshold technique refers to two required threshold inputs that are used to extract the periosteal and endosteal surfaces of the cortex. The proposed method was tested against the gold standard, semi-automated hand contouring, using 45 datasets: mouse, rat, human, and cadaver data from the tibia or radius with nominal isotropic resolutions of 10-82????m. The performance of the proposed method to segment cortical and trabecular compartments was evaluated qualitatively from visualizations and quantitatively based on morphological measurements. Visual inspection confirmed successful segmentation of all datasets using the new method, with qualitatively better results when applied to the human and cadaver data compared to the gold standard. The dual threshold algorithm was able to extract thin and porous cortices, whereas some clipping and perforations occurred for the gold standard. Morphological parameters measured for segmentation by the proposed method versus the gold standard agreed (95{\%} confidence) for Tb.Th, Tb.Sp, and Tb.N, but not Ct.Th and BV/TV for the human and cadaver datasets. Nonetheless, correlations ranged from 0.95 to 1.00 for all morphological parameters except the cadaver Ct.Th because systematic errors were present. Poor agreement for Ct.Th and BV/TV was due to qualitatively incorrect segmentation by the gold standard when the cortex was thin compared to trabeculae, or operator bias during hand contouring. Since Tb.Th, Tb.Sp, and Tb.N were insensitive to segmentation method, despite operator bias, they are robust parameters for inter-site comparisons. The dual threshold method offers a robust and fully-automated alternative to the gold standard that can efficiently segment bone regions with accurate and repeatable results. The algorithm can be easily implemented since it uses simple image analysis tools. Two input thresholds allow adjustment of the masked output, and are easily determined by trial and error. Using the same input thresholds for similar datasets assures maximal consistency while alleviating time consuming semi-automated contouring. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Circulating pre-OCs may be recruited to locally inflamed sites through specific interactions with activated microvasculature. We found that HMVECs stimulated the adhesion and TEM of circulating pre-OCs, in an ICAM-1- and CD44-dependent manner, leading to greater RANKL-induced OC formation and bone pit resorption. INTRODUCTION: Inflammation is critical for healing processes but causes severe tissue destruction when chronic. Local osteoclast (OC) formation and bone resorption may increase at inflammatory sites through multiple mechanisms, including direct stimulation by inflamed microvasculature of circulating OC precursor (pre-OC) migration through a blood vessel barrier into bone or joint tissue. How this might occur is not yet well understood. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cytokine-activated human microvascular endothelial cell (HMVEC) monolayers, with or without IL-1 and TNF-alpha preactivation (24 h), were incubated in adhesion (1-3 h) or porous transwell transendothelial migration (TEM; 3 h) assays with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs) or CD14+ monocyte or CD14- lymphocyte subsets. The number of cells that adhered or transmigrated, and their ability to thereafter develop with macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) + RANKL into bone pit-resorbing OCs, were analyzed. Immunostaining and neutralizing antibodies to key cell adhesion molecules were used to determine their potential involvement in stimulated CD14+ monocyte TEM. RESULTS: M-CSF + RANKL caused OC and bone pit formation only from hPBMCs and CD14+ cells but not CD14- cells. Adhesion of hPBMCs or CD14+ cells but not CD14- cells was stimulated by cytokine preactivation of HMVECs and led to the full capture of all circulating pre-OCs capable of developing into OCs. Cytokine-preactivated HMVECs also promoted the postadhesion TEM of hPBMCs and CD14+ populations, resulting in markedly greater OC formation and bone pit resorption by transmigrated cells. Immunodetectable vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1), and CD44 levels increased on cytokine-treated HMVEC surfaces, and neutralizing antibodies to ICAM-1 or CD44, but not VCAM-1 or platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM-1), inhibited stimulated CD14+ cell TEM through activated HMVECs. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first demonstration that cytokine-activated HMVECs efficiently capture and promote the TEM of circulating pre-OCs capable of differentiating into bone-resorbing OCs. Thus, direct pre-OC recruitment by activated microvasculature at inflammatory sites may significantly contribute to normal OC bone remodeling during fracture healing or exacerbate pathological bone loss in various chronic inflammatory disorders.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Little is known about the mechanical stabilization afforded by new materials proposed for use with vertebroplasty. This comparative ex vivo biomechanical study was designed to determine the strength and stiffness of osteoporotic vertebral bodies (VBs) subjected to compression fractures and stabilized with bipedicular injections of Cranioplastic altered in a manner consistent with the practice of vertebroplasty or BoneSource cement. METHODS: VBs T8-T10 and L2-L4 from 10 fresh spines were harvested from female cadavers (aged 91.5 years +/- 3.9 at death). These were screened for bone density (t score, -4.9 +/- 1.4; bone mineral density, 0.61 g/cm(2) +/- 0.19), disarticulated, and compressed to determine initial strength and stiffness. The fractured VBs were stabilized with bipedicular injections of a predetermined quantity and type of cement and then re-crushed. RESULTS: At both the thoracic and lumbar levels, VBs repaired with altered Cranioplastic resulted in significantly greater strength (P {\textless}.05) than that in their prefracture states, whereas those repaired with BoneSource were restored to their initial strength. Cranioplastic resulted in significantly stronger repairs than BoneSource in the thoracic region; however, repair strengths in the lumbar region were not significantly different. The repaired stiffness was significantly lower than the initial stiffness in all treatments and in both regions. Differences in the repaired stiffness between the treatment groups in either region and differences in the mechanical parameters obtained by adding an additional 2 mL of BoneSource were not significant. CONCLUSION: Both materials in the volumes used either restored or increased VB strength, but none restored stiffness.},

	Abstract = {Knowledge of the location of initial regions of failure within the vertebra - cortical shell, cortical endplates vs. trabecular bone, as well as anatomic location - may lead to improved understanding of the mechanisms of aging, disease and treatment. The overall objective of this study was to identify the location of the bone tissue at highest risk of initial failure within the vertebral body when subjected to compressive loading. Toward this end, micro-CT-based 60-micron voxel-sized, linearly elastic, finite element models of a cohort of thirteen elderly (age range: 54-87??years, 75 ?? 9??years) female whole vertebrae without posterior elements were virtually loaded in compression through a simulated disc. All bone tissues within each vertebra having either the maximum or minimum principal strain beyond its 90th percentile were defined as the tissue at highest risk of initial failure within that particular vertebral body. Our results showed that such high-risk tissue first occurred in the trabecular bone and that the largest proportion of the high-risk tissue also occurred in the trabecular bone. The amount of high-risk tissue was significantly greater in and adjacent to the cortical endplates than in the mid-transverse region. The amount of high-risk tissue in the cortical endplates was comparable to or greater than that in the cortical shell regardless of the assumed Poisson's ratio of the simulated disc. Our results provide new insight into the micromechanics of failure of trabecular and cortical bone within the human vertebra, and taken together, suggest that, during strenuous compressive loading of the vertebra, the tissue near and including the endplates is at the highest risk of initial failure. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

	Abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine the accuracy of specimen-specific finite element models of untreated and cement-augmented vertebrae by direct comparison with experimental results. Eleven single cadaveric vertebrae were imaged using micro computed tomography (microCT) and tested to failure in axial compression in the laboratory. Four of the specimens were first augmented with PMMA cement to simulate a prophylactic vertebroplasty. Specimen-specific finite element models were then generated using semi-automated methods. An initial set of three untreated models was used to determine the optimum conversion factors from the image data to the bone material properties. Using these factors, the predicted stiffness and strength were determined for the remaining specimens (four untreated, four augmented). The model predictions were compared with the corresponding experimental data. Good agreement was found with the non-augmented specimens in terms of stiffness (root-mean-square (r.m.s.) error 12.9 per cent) and strength (r.m.s. error 14.4 per cent). With the augmented specimens, the models consistently overestimated both stiffness and strength (r.m.s. errors 65 and 68 per cent). The results indicate that this method has the potential to provide accurate predictions of vertebral behaviour prior to augmentation. However, modelling the augmented bone with bulk material properties is inadequate, and more detailed modelling of the cement region is required to capture the bone-cement interactions if the models are to be used to predict the behaviour following vertebroplasty.},

@article{Adams2005,
	Abstract = {Current trends in spine research are reviewed in order to suggest future opportunities for biomechanics. Recent studies show that psychosocial factors influence back pain behaviour but are not important causes of pain itself. Severe back pain most often arises from intervertebral discs, apophyseal joints and sacroiliac joints, and physical disruption of these structures is strongly but variably linked to pain. Typical forms of structural disruption can be reproduced by severe mechanical loading in-vitro, with genetic and age-related weakening sometimes leading to injury under moderate loading. Biomechanics can be used to quantify spinal loading and movements, to analyse load distributions and injury mechanisms, and to develop therapeutic interventions. The authors suggest that techniques for quantifying spinal loading should be capable of measurement "in the field" so that they can be used in epidemiological surveys and ergonomic interventions. Great accuracy is not required for this task, because injury risk depends on tissue weakness as much as peak loading. Biomechanical tissue testing and finite-element modelling should complement each other, with experiments establishing proof of concept, and models supplying detail and optimising designs. Suggested priority areas for future research include: understanding interactions between intervertebral discs and adjacent vertebrae; developing prosthetic and tissue-engineered discs; and quantifying spinal function during rehabilitation. "Mechanobiology" has perhaps the greatest future potential, because spinal degeneration and healing are both mediated by the activity of cells which are acutely sensitive to their local mechanical environment. Precise characterisation and manipulation of this environment will be a major challenge for spine biomechanics.},

	Abstract = {Computed tomography (CT)-based finite element (FE) reconstructions describe shape and density distribution of bones. Both shape and density distribution, however, can vary a lot between individuals. Shape/density indexation (usually achieved by principal component analysis--PCA) can be used to synthesize realistic models, thus overcoming the shortage of CT-based models, and helping e.g. to study fracture determinants, or steer prostheses design. The aim of this study was to describe a PCA-based statistical modelling algorithm, and test it on a large CT-based population of femora, to see if it can accurately describe and reproduce bone shape, density distribution, and biomechanics. To this aim, 115 CT-datasets showing normal femoral anatomy were collected and characterized. Isotopological FE meshes were built. Shape and density indexation procedures were performed on the mesh database. The completeness of the database was evaluated through a convergence study. The accuracy in reconstructing bones not belonging to the indexation database was evaluated through (i) leave-one-out tests (ii) comparison of calculated vs. in-vitro measured strains. Fifty indexation modes for shape and 40 for density were necessary to achieve reconstruction errors below pixel size for shape, and below 10{\%} for density. Similar errors for density, and slightly higher errors for shape were obtained when reconstructing bones not belonging to the database. The in-vitro strain prediction accuracy of the reconstructed FE models was comparable to state-of-the-art studies. In summary, the results indicate that the proposed statistical modelling tools are able to accurately describe a population of femora through finite element models.},

	Abstract = {This study tested the hypotheses that (1) cervical total disc replacement with a compressible, six-degree-of-freedom prosthesis would allow restoration of physiologic range and quality of motion, and (2) the kinematic response would not be adversely affected by variability in prosthesis position in the sagittal plane. Twelve human cadaveric cervical spines were tested. Prostheses were implanted at C5-C6. Range of motion (ROM) was measured in flexion-extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation under $\pm$ 1.5 Nm moments. Motion coupling between axial rotation and lateral bending was calculated. Stiffness in the high flexibility zone was evaluated in all three testing modes, while the center of rotation (COR) was calculated using digital video fluoroscopic images in flexion-extension. Implantation in the middle position increased ROM in flexion-extension from 13.5 $\pm$ 2.3 to 15.7 $\pm$ 3.0$\,^{\circ}$ (p {\textless} 0.05), decreased axial rotation from 9.9 $\pm$ 1.7 to 8.3 $\pm$ 1.6$\,^{\circ}$ (p {\textless} 0.05), and decreased lateral bending from 8.0 $\pm$ 2.1 to 4.5 $\pm$ 1.1$\,^{\circ}$ (p {\textless} 0.05). Coupled lateral bending decreased from 0.62 $\pm$ 0.16 to 0.39 $\pm$ 0.15$\,^{\circ}$ for each degree of axial rotation (p {\textless} 0.05). Flexion-extension stiffness of the reconstructed segment with the prosthesis in the middle position did not deviate significantly from intact controls, whereas the lateral bending and axial rotation stiffness values were significantly larger than intact. Implanting the prosthesis in the posterior position as compared to the middle position did not significantly affect the ROM, motion coupling, or stiffness of the reconstructed segment; however, the COR location better approximated intact controls with the prosthesis midline located within $\pm$ 1 mm of the disc-space midline. Overall, the kinematic response after reconstruction with the compressible, six-degree-of-freedom prosthesis within $\pm$ 1 mm of the disc-space midline approximated the intact response in flexion-extension. Clinical studies are needed to understand and interpret the effects of limited restoration of lateral bending and axial rotation motions and motion coupling on clinical outcome.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vertebroplasty has become a common treatment for painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures, but there is limited evidence to support its use. METHODS: We performed a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which participants with one or two painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures that were of less than 12 months' duration and unhealed, as confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging, were randomly assigned to undergo vertebroplasty or a sham procedure. Participants were stratified according to treatment center, sex, and duration of symptoms ({\textless} 6 weeks or {\textgreater} or = 6 weeks). Outcomes were assessed at 1 week and at 1, 3, and 6 months. The primary outcome was overall pain (on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 being the maximum imaginable pain) at 3 months. RESULTS: A total of 78 participants were enrolled, and 71 (35 of 38 in the vertebroplasty group and 36 of 40 in the placebo group) completed the 6-month follow-up (91{\%}). Vertebroplasty did not result in a significant advantage in any measured outcome at any time point. There were significant reductions in overall pain in both study groups at each follow-up assessment. At 3 months, the mean (+/-SD) reductions in the score for pain in the vertebroplasty and control groups were 2.6+/-2.9 and 1.9+/-3.3, respectively (adjusted between-group difference, 0.6; 95{\%} confidence interval, -0.7 to 1.8). Similar improvements were seen in both groups with respect to pain at night and at rest, physical functioning, quality of life, and perceived improvement. Seven incident vertebral fractures (three in the vertebroplasty group and four in the placebo group) occurred during the 6-month follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: We found no beneficial effect of vertebroplasty as compared with a sham procedure in patients with painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures, at 1 week or at 1, 3, or 6 months after treatment.

	Abstract = {Study Design. This was a retrospective review of 47 consecutive patients (1995-1998) in whom percutaneous intraosseous methylmethacrylate cement injection (percutaneous vertebroplasty) was used to treat osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures and spinal column neoplasms. Objectives. To present initial results regarding pain relief, spinal stabilization, and complications after treatment with percutaneous vertebroplasty. Summary of Background Data. Percutaneous vertebroplasty was developed in France in the late 1980s. Several European reports have described excellent results for treatment of compression fractures and neoplasms. The procedure was not performed in the United States until 1994. Only a single series of 29 patients treated in the United States has been reported. Methods. A retrospective review was conducted of 47 consecutive patients with 84 vertebrae treated with percutaneous vertebroplasty. Thirty-eight patients with 70 vertebrae had symptomatic, osteoporotic fractures and had failed medical therapy. Eight patients with 13 vertebrae had primary or metastatic neoplasms. One patient had a hemangioma. Immediate and long-term pain response, spinal stability, and complications were evaluated. Results. Among the 38 patients treated for osteoporotic fractures, 24 (63{\%}) had marked to complete pain relief, 12 (32{\%}) moderate relief and 2 (5{\%}) no significant change. Only 4 of the 8 patients with malignancies had significant pain relief. In 7 of these patients, no further vertebral compression occurred, and spinal canal compromise was prevented. The patient with the hemangioma had no significant pain reduction. Minor complications occurred in 3 (6{\%}) patients. Conclusions. Percutaneous vertebroplasty provided significant pain relief in a high percentage of patients with osteoporotic fractures. The procedure provided spinal stabilization in patients with malignancies but did not produce consistent pain relief. Complications were minor and infrequent. Percutaneous vertebroplasty is a promising therapy for patients with osteoporotic fractures and for selected vertebral column neoplasms.},

	Abstract = {A number of papers have recently emphasised the importance of verification, validation and sensitivity testing in computational studies within the field of biomechanical engineering. This review examines the methods used in the development of spinal finite element models with a view to a standardised framework of verification, validation and sensitivity analysis. The scope of this paper is restricted to models of the vertebra, the intervertebral disc and short spinal segments. In the case of single vertebral models, specimen-specific methods have been developed, which allow direct validation against experimental tests. The focus of intervertebral disc modelling has been on representing the complex material properties and further sensitivity testing is required to fully understand the relative roles of these input parameters. In order to construct complex multi-component short segment models, many geometric and material parameters are required, some of which are yet to be fully characterised. There are also major challenges in terms of short segment model validation. Throughout the review, areas of good practise are highlighted and recommendations for future development are proposed, taking a step towards more robust spinal modelling procedures, promoting acceptance from the wider biomechanics community. ?? 2008.},

	Abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Systematic literature review.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty using the data presented in published clinical studies, with respect to patient pain relief, restoration of mobility and vertebral body height, complication rate, and incidence of new adjacent vertebral fractures.

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty have been gaining popularity for treating vertebral fractures. Current reviews provide an overview of the procedures but are not comprehensive and tend to rely heavily on personal experience. This article aimed to compile all available data and evaluate the clinical outcome of the 2 procedures.

METHODS: This is a systematic review of all the available data presented in peer-reviewed published clinical trials. The methodological quality of included studies was evaluated, and data were collected targeting specific standard measurements. Where possible, a quantitative aggregation of the data was performed.

RESULTS: A large proportion of subjects had some pain relief, including 87{\%} with vertebroplasty and 92{\%} with kyphoplasty. Vertebral height restoration was possible using kyphoplasty (average 6.6 degrees ) and for a subset of patients using vertebroplasty (average 6.6 degrees ). Cement leaks occurred for 41{\%} and 9{\%} of treated vertebrae for vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, respectively. New fractures of adjacent vertebrae occurred for both procedures at rates that are higher than the general osteoporotic population but approximately equivalent to the general osteoporotic population that had a previous vertebral fracture.

CONCLUSIONS: The problem with stating definitely that vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are safe and effective procedures is the lack of comparative, blinded, randomized clinical trials. Standardized evaluative methods should be adopted.},

	Abstract = {Infiltrating osteoporotic cancellous bone with bone cement (vertebroplasty) is a novel surgical procedure to stabilize and prevent osteoporotic vertebral fractures. Short-term clinical and biomechanical results are encouraging; however, so far no reports on long-term results have been published. Our clinical observations suggest that vertebroplasty may induce subsequent fractures in the vertebrae adjacent to the ones augmented. At this point, there is only a limited understanding of what causes these fractures. We have previously hypothesized that adjacent fractures may result from a shift in stiffness and load following rigid augmentation. The purpose of this study is to determine the load shift in a lumbar motion segment following vertebroplasty. A finite-element (FE) model of a lumbar motion segment (L4-L5) was used to quantify and compare the pre- and post-augmentation stiffness and loading (load shift) of the intervertebral (IV) disc adjacent to the augmented vertebra in response to quasi-static compression. The results showed that the rigid cement augmentation underneath the endplates acted as an upright pillar that severely reduced the inward bulge of the endplates of the augmented vertebra. The bulge of the augmented endplate was reduced to 7{\%} of its value before the augmentation, resulting in a stiffening of the IV joint by approximately 17{\%}, and of the whole motion segment by approximately 11{\%}. The IV pressure accordingly increased by approximately 19{\%}, and the inward bulge of the endplate adjacent to the one augmented (L4 inferior) increased considerably, by approximately 17{\%}. This increase of up to 17{\%} in the inward bulge of the endplate adjacent to the one augmented may be the cause of the adjacent fractures.},

	Abstract = {In vivo loads acting at the hip joint have so far only been measured in few patients and without detailed documentation of gait data. Such information is required to test and improve wear, strength and fixation stability of hip implants. Measurements of hip contact forces with instrumented implants and synchronous analyses of gait patterns and ground reaction forces were performed in four patients during the most frequent activities of daily living. From the individual data sets an average was calculated. The paper focuses on the loading of the femoral implant component but complete data are additionally stored on an associated compact disc. It contains complete gait and hip contact force data as well as calculated muscle activities during walking and stair climbing and the frequencies of daily activities observed in hip patients. The mechanical loading and function of the hip joint and proximal femur is thereby completely documented. The average patient loaded his hip joint with 238{\%} BW (percent of body weight) when walking at about 4km/h and with slightly less when standing on one leg. This is below the levels previously reported for two other patients (Bergmann et al., Clinical Biomechanics 26 (1993) 969-990). When climbing upstairs the joint contact force is 251{\%} BW which is less than 260{\%} BW when going downstairs. Inwards torsion of the implant is probably critical for the stem fixation. On average it is 23{\%} larger when going upstairs than during normal level walking. The inter- and intra-individual variations during stair climbing are large and the highest torque values are 83{\%} larger than during normal walking. Because the hip joint loading during all other common activities of most hip patients are comparably small (except during stumbling), implants should mainly be tested with loading conditions that mimic walking and stair climbing.

	Abstract = {Vertebral fractures are recognised as a hallmark of osteoporosis, yet little is known of their epidemiology. This deficiency limits accurate characterisation of the public health importance of osteoporosis. Assessment of the impact of vertebral fractures has been hampered by the absence of formal criteria for identifying fractures on a thoracolumbar radiograph. Initial methods relying upon subjective radiological assessments have given way to morphometric measurements of vertebral heights, with deformities defined according to various algorithms. These methods have been used in a series of studies performed in Rochester, MN, to determine the incidence, outcome, and time trends of vertebral deformities. The results suggest a prevalence rate of vertebral deformity of 25.3 per-100 Rochester women aged 50 years and over (95{\%} CI, 22.3--28.2), with an estimated incidence of 17.8 per 1,000 person-years. The incidence of clinically diagnosed vertebral fractures among women in the same population was 5.3 per 1,000 person-years, suggesting that around 30{\%} of such deformities in women receive clinical attention. Morphometric measurement on the radiographs of women with clinically diagnosed fractures revealed that 80{\%} had grade 2 ({\textgreater}4 SD) deformities. Comparable data on the occurrence and health impact of vertebral deformities throughout Europe are urgently required. The European Vertebral Osteoporosis Study (EVOS) is a multicentre epidemiological study that aims to address this issue. It is designed as a radiographic prevalence study in 34 European centres. Age-stratified samples of 300 men and 300 women aged 50 years and over are selected from population registers in each centre, and undergo standardised thoracolumbar radiography, anthropometry, and a structured interview on current and past risk factors for osteoporosis. Data on the design of the study, und preliminary results on the prevalence of vertebral deformities and individual risk factors in selected centres will be presented elsewhere.},

	Abstract = {A major determinant of the risk of hip fracture in a fall from standing height is the force applied to the femur at impact. This force is determined by the impact velocity of the hip and the effective mass, stiffness, and damping of the body at the moment of contact. We have developed a simple experiment (the pelvis release experiment) to measure the effective stiffness and damping of the body when a step change in force is applied to the lateral aspect of the hip. Results from pelvis release experiments with 14 human subjects suggest that both increased soft tissue thickness over the hip and impacting the ground in a relaxed state can decrease the effective stiffness of the body, and subsequently reduce peak impact forces. Comparison between our fall impact force predictions and in-vitro measures of femoral fracture strength suggest that any fall from standing height producing direct, lateral impact on the greater trochanter can fracture the elderly hip.},

	Abstract = {Fractures of the thoracic spine account for a large portion of vertebral fractures in the elderly, yet noninvasive measurements of bone mineral properties are limited to the L2-L4 vertebral bodies. The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether bone mineral properties of the lumbar spine correlate with the failure properties of thoracic vertebrae. Cadaveric lumbar segments were scanned using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) from both the lateral and anteroposterior projections. Three-body segments L1-L3 and T10-T12 were then compressed to create crush fractures in the L2 and T11 vertebral bodies, and linear correlation analyses were performed to compare each DXA measure with the failure properties of L2 and T11. Lumbar BMD from the lateral view correlated significantly with T11 ultimate load (r = 0.94, P {\textless} 0.001), as did lumbar BMD from the anteroposterior projection (r = 0.83, P = 0.001). Significant correlations were also found between both lumbar BMD and BMC and the stiffness and energy to failure of T11. Furthermore, BMD and BMC measured at L2 correlated significantly with L2 ultimate load, stiffness, and energy to failure. We conclude that bone mineral properties measured at the lumbar spine provide a valid assessment of the compressive strength of both thoracic and lumbar vertebrae. Lumbar BMD may therefore be used to derive an index for the prediction of thoracolumbar fractures to aid in the early intervention of vertebral fractures.},

	Abstract = {Wear debris, of deferent sizes, shapes and quantities, generated in artificial hip and knees is largely confined to the bone and joint interface. This debris interacts with periprosthetic tissue and may cause aseptic loosening. The purpose of this review is to summarize and collate findings of the recent demonstrations on debris characterization and their biological response that influences the occurrence in implant migration. A systematic review of peer-reviewed literature is performed, based on inclusion and exclusion criteria addressing mainly debris isolation, characterization, and biologic responses. Results show that debris characterization largely depends on their appropriate and accurate isolation protocol. The particles are found to be non-uniform in size and non-homogeneously distributed into the periprosthetic tissues. In addition, the sizes, shapes, and volumes of the particles are influenced by the types of joints, bearing geometry, material combination, and lubricant. Phagocytosis of wear debris is size dependent; high doses of submicron-sized particles induce significant level of secretion of bone resorbing factors. However, articles on wear debris from engineered surfaces (patterned and coated) are lacking. The findings suggest considering debris morphology as an important parameter to evaluate joint simulator and newly developed implant materials.},

	Abstract = {The objective of this study was to determine the bone mineral density (BMD) of cervical vertebrae and correlate with the lumbar spine. Fifty-seven young adult healthy male volunteers, ranging from 18 to 41 years of age, underwent quantitative computed tomography (QCT) scanning of C2-T1 and L2-L4 vertebrae. To account for correlations, repeated measures techniques were used to compare data as a function of spinal level and region. Linear regression methods were used (+/-95{\%} CI) to compare data as a function of spinal level and region. The mean age and body height were 25.0 +/- 5.8 years and 181.0 +/- 7.6 cm. BMD decreased from the rostral to caudal direction along the spinal column. Grouped data indicated that the neck is the densest followed by the first thoracic vertebra and low back with mean BMD of 256.0 +/- 48.1, 194.3 +/- 44.2, and 172.2 +/- 28.4 mg/cm(3), respectively; differences were statistically significant. While BMD did not vary significantly between the three lumbar bodies, neck vertebrae demonstrated significant trends. The matrix of correlation coefficients between BMD and spinal level indicated that the relationship is strong in the lumbar (r = 0.92-0.96) and cervical (r = 0.73-0.92) spines. Data from the present study show that the trabecular bony architecture of the neck is significantly different from the low back. These quantitative BMD data from a controlled young adult healthy human male volunteer population may be valuable in establishing normative data specifically for the neck. From a trabecular bone density perspective, these results indicate that lumbar vertebrae cannot act as the best surrogates for neck vertebrae. Significant variations in densities among neck vertebrae, unlike the low back counterpart, may underscore the need to treat these bones as different structures.},

	Abstract = {AIM: To characterise the number and nature of the inflammatory cells seen in cases of septic or aseptic loosening of hip arthroplasty, and to establish reliable histological criteria to distinguish between these two conditions. METHODS: Histological examination of paraffin sections of periprosthetic tissues (pseudocapsule, femoral and acetabular pseudomembranes) of 523 cases of aseptic loosening and 79 cases of microbiology culture proven septic loosening. The cellular composition of the inflammatory cell infiltrate was determined semiquantitatively. RESULTS: The finding of a 2+ or greater neutrophil polymorph infiltrate (one or more cells per high power field (x400) on average after examination of 10 fields) in arthroplasty tissues correlated strongly with the microbiological diagnosis of septic loosening: diagnostic sensitivity 100{\%}, specificity 97{\%}, accuracy 99{\%}, positive predictive value 92{\%}, negative predictive value 100{\%}. The finding of a 3+ neutrophil polymorph infiltrate (five or more cells on average per high power field) had a diagnostic sensitivity of 72{\%}, specificity 100{\%}, accuracy 98{\%}, positive predictive value 100{\%}, and negative predictive value 97{\%}. In some cases of septic loosening the finding of a heavy lymphocytic and plasma cell infiltrate was of low diagnostic sensitivity. A neutrophil polymorph infiltrate (generally less than one cell per 10 high power fields) was also seen in cases of aseptic loosening. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of 2+ or more (more than one neutrophil polymorph per high power field (x400) on average after examination of at least 10 high power fields) in periprosthetic tissues provides the most sensitive and accurate histopathological criterion for distinguishing between septic and aseptic loosening of hip arthroplasty.},

	Abstract = {One hundred forty-eight retrieved modular hip prostheses of both mixed (Ti-6Al-4V/Co-Cr) and similar (Co-Cr/Co-Cr) metal combinations were examined and positive evidence of corrosive attack was found in the conical taper region between head and stem. Significant corrosion was observed in both mixed and similar metal combinations with 16{\%} of necks and 35{\%} of heads (for mixed-metal cases), and 14{\%} of necks and 23{\%} of heads (for similar-metal cases) showing moderate to severe corrosive attack. There was a significant correlation between the percentage of prostheses with moderate to severe corrosion and the duration of implantation for both mixed and similar metal cases, indicating that this corrosion process is progressive in time. Moderate to severe corrosion was seen as early as 2.5 and 11 months (mixed and similar metals, respectively). Scanning electron microscopy and x-ray analysis identified several forms of corrosive attack in the cobalt-based component of the taper. These included, for both mixed and same metal combinations: preferential dissolution of cobalt, fretting, and pitting; mixed metals only: the formation of a Ti-Cr-Mo interfacial phase and interdendritic corrosion; and for similar metals: intergranular attack adjacent to grain boundaries enriched in molybdenum and silicon. It is hypothesized that the restricted crevice environment, coupled with high cyclic stresses which cause repeated fracture of the passive oxide films in the taper, result in an unstable electrochemical environment within the crevice for both the cobalt alloy and Ti-alloy passive films. The passivity of these alloys is subsequently lost and active attack of the taper results. Also, the repeated fracturing of the passive films will result in large amounts of corrosion products being formed. This corrosion and particulate accumulation could result in loss of mechanical integrity of the implants in vivo, create particles for third body wear, and release particles into the surrounding tissues.},

	Abstract = {Understanding when entrants might have an advantage over an industry's incumbent firms in developing and adopting new technologies is a question which several scholars have explained in terms of technological capabilities or organizational dynamics. This paper proposes that the value network---the context within which a firm competes and solves customers' problems---is an important factor affecting whether incumbent or entrant firms will most successfully innovate. In a study of technology development in the disk drive industry, the authors found that incumbents led the industry in developing and adopting new technologies of every sort identified by earlier scholars ---at component and architectural levels; competency-enhancing and competency-destroying; incremental and radical---as long as the technology addressed customers' needs within the value network in which the incumbents competed. Entrants led in developing and adopting technologies which addressed user needs in different, emerging value networks. It is in these innovations, which disrupted established trajectories of technological progress in established markets, that attackers proved to have an advantage. The rate of improvement in product performance which technologists provide may exceed the rate of improvement demanded in established markets. This mismatch between trajectories enables firms entering emerging value networks subsequently to attack the industry's established markets as well.},

There is considerable debate about which criteria should be used to define a vertebral fracture because there is no consistent relation between symptoms and the degree of vertebral deformity. However, it is the more significant vertebral body deformities that are most closely associated with frequent or severe back pain, and the referrals for vertebral augmentation come mainly from this subset of patients. In addition to their vertebral fractures, these patients typically have osteoporosis or elevated bone turnover, and they are at greatly increased risk of subsequent fractures as a result of falling or, more often, excessive spinal loads from activities of everyday living. Additional risk factors for new vertebral fractures include the number and severity of vertebral deformities at baseline. Moreover, new fractures are most likely in nearby vertebrae, and they occur more frequently in the mid-thoracic or thoracolumbar regions of the spine. Interestingly, these are also the characteristics of the subsequent fractures of contiguous vertebrae considered by some to represent a complication of vertebral augmentation, yet they characterize vertebral fracture risk even in untreated patients. Vertebral fractures are very common among older men and postmenopausal women; they are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality; and they may have a devastating impact on the patient's quality of life. Vertebral augmentation may be able to help many of these patients, although opportunities exist to optimize management strategies with respect to the other factors that influence long-term outcomes in this patient population.},

	Abstract = {Background: The sheep spine is often used as a model for the human spine, although the degree to which these spines are anatomi-cally comparable has yet to be categorically established. The purpose of this study was to investigate the characteristic anatomical dimensions of the sheep spine and to compare these with existing human data. Methods: Five complete spines were measured to determine 21 dimen-sions from the pedicles, spinal canal, transverse and spinous processes, facets, endplates, and disc. Results: The results showed that sheep and human vertebrae are most similar in the thoracic and lumbar regions, although they show substan-tial differences in certain dimensions. Morphological variations as a function of spine level typically were well matched in the two species. Conclusions: Sheep spine may be a useful model for experiments related to the gross structure of the thoracic or lumbar spine, with certain limitations for the cervical spine. A thorough database has been provided for deciding the appropriateness of using the sheep spine as a model for the human spine. Anat. Rec. 247:542--555, 1997. r 1997 Wiley-Liss, Inc. Fresh human specimens are increasingly difficult to obtain for in vitro experiments, and when available such specimens are required in large quantities to overcome the wide scattering effect associated with biological variability (Ashman et al., 1989). Specifically, to provide a model for the human spine, animals such as sheep, goat, pig, calf, and dog have been used. Such animal specimens are more readily available (Edmons-ton et al., 1994) and show much better homogeneity than do human specimens when selected for breed, sex, age, and weight (Eggli et al., 1992; Gurwitz et al., 1993). Sheep in particular are often used as a model for in vivo studies concerning, for instance, histomorphology of the intervertebral disc (Osti et al., 1990; Moore et al., 1992; Gunzburg et al., 1993) and biomechanical efficacy of fusion techniques in the lumbar spine (Ahlgren et al., 1994). Sheep spines have also been used in vitro to study the initial stabilizing effect of spinal implants in the lumbar (Slater et al., 1988; Yamamuro et al., 1990; Nagel et al., 1991) and cervical regions (Vazquez-Seonae et al., 1993). Comprehensive, quantitative data on the characteris-tic anatomy of the sheep spine, however, are lacking. Knowledge of the similarities and differences between sheep and human spines is essential for interpreting results from studies using this model and is needed to establish for which investigations the sheep model is suitable. Thus, the purpose of this study was to provide an anatomical database of the sheep spine and a detailed comparison with the human spine to improve its utility as a model for the human spine in in vivo and in vitro experiments.},

However, little is known about the TDR kinematics in this setting.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Eight human cadaveric cervical spines (C2-T1, age: 59 $\pm$ 8.6 years) were tested intact, after simulated two-level fusion (C4-C6) in lordotic alignment and then in straight alignment, and after C3-C4 TDR above the C4-C6 fusion in lordotic and straight alignments. Fusion was simulated using an external fixator apparatus, allowing easy adjustment of C4-C6 fusion alignment, and restoration to intact state upon disassembly. Specimens were tested in flexion-extension using hybrid testing protocols.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The external fixator device significantly reduced range of motion (ROM) at C4-C6 to 2.0 $\pm$ 0.6$\,^{\circ}$, a reduction of 89 $\pm$ 3.0{\%} (P {\textless} 0.05). Removal of the fusion construct restored the motion response of the spinal segments to their intact state. The C3-C4 TDR resulted in less motion as compared to the intact segment when the disc prosthesis was implanted either as a stand-alone procedure or above a two-level fusion. The decrease in motion of C3-C4 TDR was significant for both lordotic and straight fusions across C4-C6 (P {\textless} 0.05). Flexion and extension moments needed to bring the cervical spine to similar C2 motion endpoints significantly increased for the TDR above a two-level fusion compared to TDR alone (P {\textless} 0.05). Lordotic fusion required significantly greater flexion moment, whereas straight fusion required significantly greater extension moment (P {\textless} 0.05).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: TDR placed adjacent to a two-level fusion is subjected to a more challenging biomechanical environment as compared to a stand-alone TDR. An artificial disc used in such a clinical scenario should be able to accommodate the increased moment loads without causing impingement of its endplates or undue wear during the expected life of the prosthesis.},

Degradation may result from electrochemical dissolution phenomena, wear, or a synergistic combination of the two. Electrochemical processes may include generalized corrosion, uniformly affecting the entire surface of the implant, and localized corrosion, affecting either regions of the device that are shielded from the tissue fluids (crevice corrosion) or seemingly random sites on the surface (pitting corrosion). Electrochemical and mechanical processes (for example, stress corrosion cracking, corrosion fatigue, and fretting corrosion) may interact, causing premature structural failure and accelerated release of metal particles and ions.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vertebroplasty has become a common treatment for painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures, but there is limited evidence to support its use. METHODS: We performed a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which participants with one or two painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures that were of less than 12 months' duration and unhealed, as confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging, were randomly assigned to undergo vertebroplasty or a sham procedure. Participants were stratified according to treatment center, sex, and duration of symptoms ({\textless} 6 weeks or {\textgreater} or = 6 weeks). Outcomes were assessed at 1 week and at 1, 3, and 6 months. The primary outcome was overall pain (on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 being the maximum imaginable pain) at 3 months. RESULTS: A total of 78 participants were enrolled, and 71 (35 of 38 in the vertebroplasty group and 36 of 40 in the placebo group) completed the 6-month follow-up (91{\%}). Vertebroplasty did not result in a significant advantage in any measured outcome at any time point. There were significant reductions in overall pain in both study groups at each follow-up assessment. At 3 months, the mean (+/-SD) reductions in the score for pain in the vertebroplasty and control groups were 2.6+/-2.9 and 1.9+/-3.3, respectively (adjusted between-group difference, 0.6; 95{\%} confidence interval, -0.7 to 1.8). Similar improvements were seen in both groups with respect to pain at night and at rest, physical functioning, quality of life, and perceived improvement. Seven incident vertebral fractures (three in the vertebroplasty group and four in the placebo group) occurred during the 6-month follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: We found no beneficial effect of vertebroplasty as compared with a sham procedure in patients with painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures, at 1 week or at 1, 3, or 6 months after treatment.

@article{yamada2009cementless,
	Abstract = {Cementless total hip replacement (THR) is rapidly being accepted as the surgery for arthritic diseases of the hip joint. The bone-ingrowth rate in porous-type cementless implants was about 90{\%} over 10 years after surgery, showing that biological fixation of cementless THR was well maintained on both the stem and cup sides. As for the stress shielding of the femur operated using a distal fixation-type stem, severe bone resorption was observed. The severe bone resorption group showed continuous progression for more than 10 years after surgery. Stem loosening directly caused by stress shielding has been considered less likely; however, close attention should be paid to bone resorption-associated disorders including femoral fracture. Cementless cups have several specific problems. It is difficult to decide whether a cup should be placed in the physiological position for the case of acetabular dysplasia by bone grafting or at a relatively higher position without bone grafting. The bone-ingrowth rate was lower in the group with en bloc bone grafting, and the reactive line was frequently noted in the bone-grafted region. Although no data indicated that en bloc bone grafting directly led to poor outcomes, such as loosening, cup placement at a higher site without bone grafting is now selected by most operators. The polyethylene liner in a cementless cup is thinned due to the metal cup thickness; however, it has been suggested that the apparent relation between the cup size and the wear rate was absent as long as a cementless cup is used. Comparative study indicated cementless THR was inferior with regard to the yearly polyethylene wear rate and incidence of osteolysis on both the stem and cup sides. Meta-analysis study on the survival rate between cement and cementless THR reported that cemented THR was slightly superior. It should be considered that specific problems for cementless THR, especially with regard to polyethylene wear, do occur. },

Sterilisation of UHMWPE components by gamma irradiation in air causes chain scissions which initiate a long-term oxidative process that degrades the chemical and mechanical properties of the polyethylene. Using a tri-pin-on-disc tribometer we studied the effect of ageing for ten years after gamma irradiation in air on the volumetric wear, particle size distribution and the number of particles produced by UHMWPE when sliding against a stainless-steel counterface. The aged and irradiated material produced six times more volumetric wear and 34 times more wear particles per unit load per unit sliding distance than non-sterilised UHMWPE. Our findings indicate that oxidative degradation of polyethylene after gamma irradiation in air with ageing produces more wear.},

	Abstract = {AIM: To determine whether load directions for stumbling are similar to those for common activities and whether stumbling can be realistically simulated under laboratory conditions without endangering the patients. METHOD: The magnitudes and directions of hip contact forces were measured during real and simulated stumbling and compared with those found during various other everyday activities. Measurements were obtained by use of hip implants with built-in load sensors and telemetry. RESULTS: Peak forces are approximately twice as high during real stumbling as during any other activity and may range higher than eight-times the body weight. Simulated stumbling leads to much lower contact forces, especially if this happens after a warning. Accidental stumbling in everyday situations should, therefore, be avoided, especially in patients with hip replacements or arthrosis. CONCLUSIONS: The directions of peak hip contact forces relative to the femoral bone are nearly constant for any activity, including real stumbling. This observation supports the assumption that muscle and bone anatomy plus muscle function are optimized in order to minimize stresses in bone and muscles. Any impairment of such a mechanically balanced system will increase the musculoskeletal loads. Malposition of total hip implants or muscle deficits caused by the surgical approach must, therefore, be avoided or minimized.},

@article{ingham2000biological,
	Abstract = {The vast majority of total hip prostheses currently implanted consist of a hard metal or ceramic femoral head articulating against an ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) acetabular cup. Over the last 10 years, evidence has accumulated to show that these prostheses are prone to failure due to late aseptic loosening and few survive beyond 25 years. With an increasing need to implant hip prostheses in the younger, more active patient the need to understand the mechanisms of failure and to develop artificial hip joints using alternative materials have become major issues in the orthopaedic community. This review focuses initially on our current understanding of the biological reactions to UHMWPE prosthetic wear debris in vivo and in vitro since this is believed to be the main cause of late aseptic loosening. While the precise mechanisms of osteolysis induced by UHMWPE wear debris have not been elucidated, the major message to emerge is that it is not the wear volume that determines the biological response to the debris, but the concentration of the wear volume that is within the critical size range (0.2-0.8 micron) for macrophage activation. The review then considers whether the problem of wear-debris-induced osteolysis may be overcome with the use of new generation metal-on-metal or ceramic-on-ceramic prostheses. For metal-on-metal prostheses, the prospects for increasing the osteolysis free life of the implant are good but additional biological problems associated with the nanometre size and reactivity of the wear particles in vivo may emerge. For the ceramic-on-ceramic prostheses, although initial prospects are encouraging, more data are needed on the characteristics of the wear particles generated in vivo before predictions can be made. It is concluded that the pre-clinical testing of any new materials for joint replacement must include an analysis of the wear particle characteristics and their biological reactivity in addition to the usual assessment of wear.},

@article{Ritzel1997,
	Abstract = {The object of this study was to analyze the cortical thickness (Ct.Th) of the ventral and dorsal shell of the vertebral bodies throughout the human spine in aging and in osteoporosis. Therefore, the complete front column of the spine of 26 autopsy cases (aged 17-90, mean 42 years) without diseases affecting the skeleton and of 11 cases (aged 58-92, mean 77 years) with proven osteoporosis were removed. A sagittal segment prepared through the center of all vertebral bodies was undecalcified, embedded in plastic, ground to a 1 mm thick block, and stained using a modification of the von Kossa method. The analysis included the measurement of the mean cortical thickness of both the ventral and dorsal shell, respectively (from the third cervical to the fifth lumbar vertebral body). The qualitative investigation of the structure of the cortical ring completed the analysis. The presented data revealed a biphasic curve for both the ventral and dorsal shell, skeletally intact with high values of the cortical thickness in the cervical spine (285 microm), and a decrease in the thoracic (244 microm) and an increase in the lumbar spine (290 microm). The mean thickness of the ventral shell is in general greater than the thickness of the dorsal shell in both skeletally normal and osteoporotic cases. The cortical thickness of the spine showed no gender-specific differences (p = NS). There was a slight decrease of the cortical thickness with aging; however, this decrease and the correlation of cortical thickness to age was only significant below vertebral body T8 (r = 0.225-0.574; p(r) {\textless} 0.05-0.005). Most interestingly, however, osteoporosis presents itself with a highly significant loss of cortical thickness throughout the whole spine. This decrease of cortical thickness was more marked in the dorsal shell (p {\textless} 0.05) than in the ventral shell (ventral from C3 to T6 [p {\textless} 0.05] below T6 [p = NS]). We therefore conclude that in osteoporosis the loss of spinal bone mass is not only a loss of trabecular structure but also a loss of cortical thickness. Furthermore, these results may explain the development of regions of least resistance within the spine in aging and the clustering of osteoporotic fractures in the lower thoracic and lumbar spine.},

	Abstract = {Background context Percutaneous vertebroplasty has been used successfully for many years in the treatment of painful compressive vertebral fractures due to osteoporosis. Purpose To compare the effect of vertebroplasty on the compressive strength of unfractured vertebral bodies. Study design Biomechanical study on cadaveric thoracic vertebrae. Methods Forty vertebral bodies from four cadaveric thoracic spines were used for this experiment. Before testing, each thoracic spine was submitted to bone density testing and radiographic evaluation to rule out any obvious fractures. Under image intensification, 6 mL of a mixture of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) with barium (8 g of barium/40 g of PMMA) was injected into every other vertebral body of each spine specimen. After vertebroplasty, all soft tissues were dissected from the spine, and the vertebral bodies were separated and potted for mechanical testing. Testing to failure was performed using a combination of axial compression and anterior flexion moments. Two pneumatic cylinders applied anterior and posterior loads at a distance ratio of 4:3 relative to the anterior vertebral body wall, whereas two additional cylinders applied lateral loads, each at a constant rate of 200 N/s. Results The average failure loads for nonvertebroplasty specimens was 6724.02$\pm$3291.70 N, whereas the specimens injected with PMMA failed at an average compressive force of 5770.50$\pm$2133.72 N. No statistically significant difference in failure loads could be detected between intact specimens and those that had undergone vertebroplasty. Conclusions Under these specific loading conditions, no significant increase in compressive strength of the vertebral bodies could be documented. This suggests that some caution should be applied to the concept of "prophylactic" vertebroplasty in patients at risk for fracture.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a method for the mechanical characterization of isotropic foams at low frequency. The objective of this study is to determine the Young's modulus, the Poisson's ratio, and the loss factor of commercially available foam plates. The method is applied on porous samples having square and circular sections. The main idea of this work is to perform quasi-static compression tests of a single foam sample followed by two juxtaposed samples having the same dimensions. The load and displacement measurements lead to a direct extraction of the elastic constants by means of normalized stiffness and normalized stiffness ratio which depend on Poisson's ratio and shape factor. The normalized stiffness is calculated by the finite element method for different Poisson ratios. The no-slip boundary conditions imposed by the loading rigid plates create interfaces with a complex strain distribution. Beforehand, compression tests were performed by means of a standard tensile machine in order to determine the appropriate pre-compression rate for quasi-static tests.},

@article{parfitt1984age,
	Abstract = {It is proposed that there are two structurally different forms of bone loss with different rates, cellular mechanisms, and biomechanical effects. Rapid bone loss is the result of excessive depth of osteoclastic resorption cavities. This leads in trabecular bone to perforation of structural elements, increased size of marrow cavities, and discontinuity of the bone structure, and in cortical bone to subendosteal cavitation and conversion of the inner third of the cortex to a trabecularlike structure, which then undergoes the same changes as the trabecular bone originally present. These structural characteristics reduce the strength of the bones to a greater extent than the reduction in the amount of bone by itself would suggest. Slow bone loss results from incomplete refilling by osteoblasts of resorption cavities of normal or reduced size. This leads to simple thinning of residual structural elements in both trabecular and cortical bone, and reduces the strength of the bones in proportion to the reduction in the amount of bone. This concept, although derived mainly from an examination of postmenopausal bone loss, may be applicable to other osteopenic states. At the same time as bone loss is occurring on the endosteal surface, rapidly or slowly, bone is being added to the periosteal surface, but much more slowly than during growth. The cellular mechanism is the converse of that causing slow bone loss, consisting of slight overfilling of shallow resorption cavities. Slow periosteal gain serves to partly offset the structural weakness resulting from endosteal loss, but is not directly compensatory.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: Vertebroplasty restores stiffness and strength of fractured vertebral bodies, but alters their stress transfer. This unwanted effect may be reduced by using more compliant cements. However, systematic experimental comparison of structural properties between standard and low-modulus augmentation needs to be done. This study investigated how standard and low-modulus cement augmentation affects apparent stiffness, strength, and endplate pressure distribution of vertebral body sections. METHODS: Thirty-nine human thoracolumbar vertebral body sections were prepared by removing cortical endplates and posterior elements. The specimens were scanned with a HR-pQCT system and loaded in the elastic range. After augmentation with standard or low-modulus cement they were scanned again and tested in two steps. First, the contact pressure distribution between specimen and loading plates was measured with pressure-sensitive films. Then, they were loaded again in the elastic range and compressed until failure. Apparent stiffness was compared before and after augmentation, whereas apparent strength of augmented specimens was compared to a non-augmented reference group. RESULTS: Vertebral body sections with fillings connecting both endplates were on average 33{\%} stiffer and 47{\%} stronger with standard cement, and 27{\%} stiffer and 30{\%} stronger with low-modulus cement. In contrast, partial fillings showed no significant strengthening for both cements and only a slight stiffness increase ({\textless}16{\%}). The averaged endplate pressure above/below the cement was on average 15{\%} lower with low-modulus cement compared to standard cement. CONCLUSION: Augmentation connecting both endplates significantly strengthened and stiffened vertebral body sections also with low-modulus cement. A trend of reduced pressure concentrations above/below the cement was observed with low-modulus cement.},

	Abstract = {An ultrasonic technique and microtensile testing were used to determine the Young's modulus of individual trabeculae and micro-specimens of cortical bone cut to similar size as individual trabeculae. The average trabecular Young's modulus measured ultrasonically and mechanically was 14.8 GPa (S.D. 1.4) and 10.4 (S.D. 3.5) and the average Young's modulus of microspecimens of cortical bone measured ultrasonically and mechanically was 20.7 GPa (S.D. 1.9) and 18.6 GPa (S.D. 3.5). With either testing technique the mean trabecular Young's modulus was found to be significantly less than that of cortical bone (p {\textless} 0.0001). However, the specimens were dried before microtensile testing so Young's modulus values may have been greater than those of trabeculae in vivo. Using Young's modulus measurements obtained from 450 cubes of cancellous bone and 256 cubes of cortical bone, Wolffs hypothesis that cortical bone is simply dense cancellous bone was tested. A multiple regression analysis that controlled for group membership showed that Young's modulus of cortical bone cannot be extrapolated from the Young's modulus vs density relationship for cancellous bone, yet the Young's modulus of trabeculae can be predicted by extrapolation from the relationship between Young's modulus vs density of the cancellous bone. These results suggest that when considered mechanically, cortical and trabecular bone are not the same material.},

	Abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: The effect of cement augmentation on an osteoporotic lumbar functional spinal unit was investigated using finite-element analysis. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the influence of cement augmentation on load transfer, stresses, and strains. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Osteoporosis is the most frequent skeletal disease of the elderly, leading to weakness of the bony structures. Cement injection into vertebral bodies has been used to treat osteoporotic compression fractures of the spine. The clinical results are encouraging. Experimental biomechanical studies showed significant increases in stiffness and strength of treated bodies. However, little is known about the consequences for the adjacent, nontreated levels. METHODS: Three-dimensional finite-element models of L2-L3 were developed and the material properties adapted to simulate osteoporosis. The influence of augmentation level as well as uni- and bipedicular filling with polymethylmethacrylate were investigated. Compression, flexion, and lateral bending were simulated. RESULTS: Augmentation increased the pressure in the nucleus pulposus and the deflection of the adjacent endplate. The stresses and strains in the vertebrae next to an augmentation were increased, and their distribution was changed. Larger areas were subjected to higher stresses and strains. The treatment clearly altered the load transfer. Changes to the overall stress and strain distribution were less pronounced for unipedicular augmentation. CONCLUSIONS: Cement augmentation restores the strength of treated vertebrae, but leads to increased endplate bulge and an altered load transfer in adjacent vertebrae. This supports the hypothesis that rigid cement augmentation may facilitate the subsequent collapse of adjacent vertebrae. Further study is required to determine the optimal reinforcement material and filling volume to minimize this effect.},

The purpose of the current study was to measure the effect that varying the monomer-to-powder ratio has on the compressive material properties of a cement (Cranioplastic) commonly used in vertebroplasty. Cylindrical specimens were prepared varying a monomer-to-polymer ratio of 0.40 to 1.07 mL/g and tested per the American Society for Testing and Materials standard F451. Specimens prepared at 0.53 mL/g, which is near the manufacturer's recommended monomer-to-polymer mixture of 0.57 mL/g, exhibited the greatest mean values for ultimate compressive stress, yield stress, and elastic modulus. Specimens prepared at higher or lower ratios exhibited diminished strength, in some cases by as much as 24{\%}. Although altering the monomer-to-powder ratio affects the cement's material properties, it is as yet unknown if the decrease is clinically significant. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Inc.},

	Abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A cadaveric biomechanical study. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the biomechanical behavior of the cervical spine after cervical total disc replacement (TDR) adjacent to a fusion as compared to a two-level fusion. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: There are concerns regarding the biomechanical effects of cervical fusion on the mobile motion segments. Although previous biomechanical studies have demonstrated that cervical disc replacement normalizes adjacent segment motion, there is a little information regarding the function of a cervical disc replacement adjacent to an anterior cervical decompression and fusion, a potentially common clinical application. METHODS: Nine cadaveric cervical spines (C3-T1, age: 60.2 $\pm$ 3.5 years) were tested under load- and displacement-control testing. After intact testing, a simulated fusion was performed at C4-C5, followed by C6-C7. The simulated fusion was then reversed, and the response of TDR at C5-C6 was measured. A hybrid construct was then tested with the TDR either below or above a single-level fusion and contrasted with a simulated two-level fusion (C4-C6 and C5-C7). RESULTS: The external fixator device used to simulate fusion significantly reduced range of motion (ROM) at C4-C5 and C6-C7 by 74.7 $\pm$ 8.1{\%} and 78.1 $\pm$ 11.5{\%}, respectively (P {\textless} 0.05). Removal of the fusion construct restored the motion response of the spinal segments to their intact state. Arthroplasty performed at C5-C6 using the porous-coated motion disc prosthesis maintained the total flexion-extension ROM to the level of the intact controls when used as a stand-alone procedure or when implanted adjacent to a single-level fusion (P {\textgreater} 0.05). The location of the single-level fusion, whether above or below the arthroplasty, did not significantly affect the motion response of the arthroplasty in the hybrid construct. Performing a two-level fusion significantly increased the motion demands on the nonoperated segments as compared to a hybrid TDR-plus fusion construct when the spine was required to reach the same motion end points. The spine with a hybrid construct required significantly less extension moment than the spine with a two-level fusion to reach the same extension end point. CONCLUSION: The porous-coated motion cervical prosthesis restored the ROM of the treated level to the intact state. When the porous-coated motion prosthesis was used in a hybrid construct, the TDR response was not adversely affected. A hybrid construct seems to offer significant biomechanical advantages over two-level fusion in terms of reducing compensatory adjacent-level hypermobility and also loads required to achieve a predetermined ROM.},

	Abstract = {Areal bone mineral density (aBMD), as measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), predicts hip fracture risk only moderately. Simulation of bone mechanics based on DXA imaging of the proximal femur, may help to improve the prediction accuracy. Therefore, we collected three (1-3) image sets, including CT images and DXA images of 34 proximal cadaver femurs (set 1, including 30 males, 4 females), 35 clinical patient CT images of the hip (set 2, including 27 males, 8 females) and both CT and DXA images of clinical patients (set 3, including 12 female patients). All CT images were segmented manually and landmarks were placed on both femurs and pelvises. Two separate statistical appearance models (SAMs) were built using the CT images of the femurs and pelvises in sets 1 and 2, respectively. The 3D shape of the femur was reconstructed from the DXA image by matching the SAMs with the DXA images. The orientation and modes of variation of the SAMs were adjusted to minimize the sum of the absolute differences between the projection of the SAMs and a DXA image. The mesh quality and the location of the SAMs with respect to the manually placed control points on the DXA image were used as additional constraints. Then, finite element (FE) models were built from the reconstructed shapes. Mean point-to-surface distance between the reconstructed shape and CT image was 1.0 mm for cadaver femurs in set 1 (leave-one-out test) and 1.4 mm for clinical subjects in set 3. The reconstructed volumetric BMD showed a mean absolute difference of 140 and 185 mg/cm(3) for set 1 and set 3 respectively. The generation of the SAM and the limitation of using only one 2D image were found to be the most significant sources of errors in the shape reconstruction. The noise in the DXA images had only small effect on the accuracy of the shape reconstruction. DXA-based FE simulation was able to explain 85{\%} of the CT-predicted strength of the femur in stance loading. The present method can be used to accurately reconstruct the 3D shape and internal density of the femur from 2D DXA images. This may help to derive new information from clinical DXA images by producing patient-specific FE models for mechanical simulation of femoral bone mechanics.},

The current study used automated methods for landmark identification to create a statistical shape model of the lumbar spine. The shape model was evaluated using compactness, generalization ability, and specificity. The primary shape modes were analyzed visually, quantitatively, and biomechanically. The biomechanical analysis was performed by using the statistical shape model with an automated method for finite element model generation to create a fully parameterized finite element model of the lumbar spine. Functional finite element models of the mean shape and the extreme shapes ($\pm$3 standard deviations) of all 17 shape modes were created demonstrating the robust nature of the methods.

	Abstract = {Osteolysis and loosening of artificial joints caused by UHMWPE wear debris has prompted renewed interest in metal-on-metal (MOM) hip prostheses. This study investigated the wear and wear debris morphology generated by MOM prostheses in a physiological anatomical hip simulator for different carbon content cobalt chrome alloys. The low carbon pairings demonstrated significantly higher "bedding in" and steady state wear rates than the mixed and high carbon pairings. The in vitro wear rates reported here were up to one or two orders of magnitude lower than the clinical wear rates for first-generation MOM hip prostheses. Two methods for characterising the metal wear debris were developed, involving digestion, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The metal wear particles characterised by the two methods were similar in size, 25-36 nm, and comparable to particles isolated from periprosthetic tissues from first and second-generation MOM hip prostheses. Due to the small size of the metal particles, the number of particles generated per year for MOM prostheses in vitro was estimated to be up to 100 times higher than the number of polyethylene particles generated per year in vivo. The volumetric wear rates were affected by the carbon content of the cobalt chrome alloy and the material combinations used. However, particle size and morphology was not affected by method of particle characterisation, the carbon content of the alloy or material combination.},

	Abstract = {A three-dimensional nonlinear finite element model (FEM) was developed for a parametric study that examined the effect of synthetic augmentation on nonfractured vertebrae. The objective was to isolate those parameters primarily responsible for the effectiveness of the procedure; bone cement volume and bone density were expected to be highly important. Injection of bone cement was simulated in the FEM of a vertebral body that included a cellular model for the trabecular core. The addition of 10{\%} and 20{\%} cement by volume resulted in an increase in failure load, and the larger volume resulted in an increase in stiffness for the vertebral body. Placement of cement within the vertebral body was not as critical a parameter as cement amount. Simulated models of very poor bone quality saw the best therapeutic benefits.},

@article{barrey2012cervical,
	Abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this experimental study was to analyse cervical spine kinematics after 1-level and 2-level total disc replacement (TDR) and compare them with those after anterior cervical arthrodesis (ACA) and hybrid construct. Kinematics and intradiscal pressures were also investigated at adjacent levels.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Twelve human cadaveric spines were evaluated in different testing conditions: intact, 1 and 2-level TDR (Discocerv{\texttrademark}, Scient'x/Alphatec), 1 and 2-level ACA, and hybrid construct. All tests were performed under load control protocol by applying pure moments loading of 2 N m in flexion/extension (FE), axial rotation (AR) and lateral bending (LB).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Reduction of ROM after 1-level TDR was only significant in LB. Implantation of additional TDR resulted in significant decrease of ROM in AR at index level. A second TDR did not affect kinematics of the previously implanted TDR in FE, AR and LB. One and 2-level arthrodesis caused significant decrease of ROM in FE, AR and LB at the index levels. No significant changes in ROM were observed at adjacent levels except for 1-level arthrodesis in FE and hybrid construct in AR. When analysis was done under the displacement-control concept, we found that 1 and 2-constructs increased adjacent levels contribution to global ROMC3-C7 during FE and that IDP at superior adjacent level increased by a factor of 6.7 and 2.3 for 2-level arthrodesis and hybrid constructs, respectively.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Although 1- and 2-level TDR restored only partially native kinematics of the cervical spine, these constructs generated better biomechanical conditions than arthrodesis at adjacent levels limiting contribution of these segments to global ROM and reducing the amount of their internal stresses.},

@article{engh1987porous,
	Abstract = {Total hip replacement using porous-coated cobalt-chrome femoral implants designed for biological fixation has been evaluated in 307 patients after two years and in 89 patients after five years. Histological study of 11 retrieved specimens showed bone ingrowth in nine and fibrous tissue fixation in two. Fixation by bone ingrowth occurred in 93{\%} of the cases in which a press fit of the stem at the isthmus was achieved, but in only 69{\%} of those without a press fit. The clinical results at two years were excellent. The incidence of pain and limp was much lower when there was either a press fit of the stem or radiographic evidence of bone ingrowth. Factors such as age, sex, and the disease process did not influence the clinical results. Most cases showed only slight resorptive remodelling of the upper femur, but in a few cases with a larger, more rigid stem, more extensive bone loss occurred. The results after five years showed no deterioration with time. Fixation by the ingrowth of bone or of fibrous tissue both appeared to be stable, but bone ingrowth gave better clinical results.$\backslash$n},
