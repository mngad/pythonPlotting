\subsection{General Methodology}

Generally SSAMs start with a rigid registration, where rotations and translations are applied to all meshes or models that form the input data set so that they share a common coordinate system.
Methods of performing the rigid registration often use an automated approach where certain degrees of freedom are restricted to ensure registration is achieved.
