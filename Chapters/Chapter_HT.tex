\section{Introduction}

Previous studies and earlier chapters have used a range of vertebrae, including
bovine, ovine and porcine among others. While all of these vertebrae have
important uses for developing methodology and understanding certain
characteristics, none share the trabecular structure, thickness of cortical
shell, axial strength of stiffness. Hence, in order to understand the
mechanical effects of vertebroplasty, human tissue is required.

Here, 14 lumbar vertebrae from four cadaveric spines have been used, with the
details shown in \cref{tab:vertebrae}.

\section{Experimental Methods}

\subsection{Dissection \& Potting}

The geometry of human lumbar vertebrae varies considerably to that of the bovine
tail vertebrae from which this methodology is based. This is characterised by
much larger posterior elements with the facets extending much lower, below the
bottom of the vertebral body. Hence, to correctly pot the human vertebrae much
more cement must be used, especially for the posterior end-cap, in order to
cover the bottom of the vertebral body and the extending posterior elements.
This means that much more of the posterior elements are constrained, therefore
restricting the rotation of the vertebral body endplates under axial load. In
addition to this the larger posterior elements which are captured within the
PMMA end-caps will transmit load and take a greater share of the load when
compared to the bovine tail vertebrae. Given that vertebroplasty attempts to
restore the stiffness of the vertebral body and that there is no understanding
of specifically how the loads are shared between the vertebral body and
posterior element, this presents a problem.

A solution to this is to remove the posterior elements, following such methods
as \cite{Wijayathunga2008,RobsonBrown2014}, where only the vertebral body is
modelled. This allows the stiffness of the vertebral body alone to be captured
and modelled. The posterior elements were removed by cutting through the
pedicles at the narrowest part, limiting damage to the region.

To pot the specimens that now lack a spinal canal, a retort stand was used to
hold the vertebra, ensuring that both endplates were level on average. The
specimen was then lowered down into the potting container leaving 5 mm between
the bottom of the vertebra and the container. PMMA was poured into the container
until the entire of the endplate was touching cement, with the edges of the
vertebral body covered. Care needed to be taken to ensure all of the endplate
was in contact with cement, given the extent of osteophytes creating non-flat
surfaces in some of the more degenerated specimens. The other side of the
vertebra was potted in a similar manner, however, due to the constraints of the
potting container a measured quantity of cement was poured prior to lowering the
vertebra into it. A spirit level ensured parallel end-caps.

\subsection{Loading}

Following previous studies \cite{Wijayathunga2008}, the vertebrae were loaded
with an initial maximum load of 800 N for similarly osteoporotic vertebrae.
However, after loading two of the initial set of vertebrae the stiffness
continued to increase up to maximum 800 N. Following loads up to 2000 N showed
that the stiffness reached a maximum between 1300 and 2000 N, with three of the
initial four specimens showing some degree of failure in the final 400 N of
loading.

\subsubsection{Maximum Stiffness Measurement}

The maximum stiffness of the vertebra was found in the same fashion as with the
bovine tail vertebrae - measuring the stiffness of segments at increments over
the length of the curve. Given that damage, especially for the intact specimens,
needs to be avoided the maximum loads used are on the conservative side. This
can mean that the maximum stiffness is potentially at the end of the data set or
that the stiffness is still increasing at the load cut off. The solution to the
latter would require a prediction of the yield point prior to experimental
loading (discussed in Section~\ref{predYield}), while the former could
potentially be solved by using smaller segment sizes when measuring the
stiffness from load - displacement results.

To allow the effect of segment size (the length of each section from which the
stiffness is found) and increment size (the size of each increment defining the
start point of each segment), the maximum stiffness finding Matlab code was
rewritten in Python. This function could then be iterated over, reporting the
maximum stiffness when using an increment size of between 1 and 100 data points
(the distance between two data points corresponds to 0.0017 mm). Changing the
increment size becomes a verification of the results using an increment size of
1 data point, given that the only negative of using the smallest possible
increment size is computational cost, which is negligible here.

\begin{figure}[ht!]

  \includegraphics[width=6in]{Chapters/Chapter_HT_images/findStiffness_1incr.png}
  \caption{The effect of reducing the segment size on the maximum stiffness
    reported from four human vertebrae loaded to 2000 N pre and post
    augmentation. Using an increment size of 1 data point (0.0017 mm) and
    segment sizes of 100 to 1 data point (0.17 mm to 0.0017 mm).}
  \label{fig:findStiffness_1incr}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[ht!]

  \caption{The effect of reducing the segment size on the maximum stiffness
    reported from four human vertebrae loaded to 2000 N pre and post
    augmentation. Using an increment size of 20 data points (0.0037 mm) and
    segment sizes of 100 to 1 data point (0.17 mm to 0.0017 mm).}
  \label{fig:findStiffness_20incr}
\end{figure}

Using an increment size of 1 data points width, as shown in \cref{fig:findStiffness_1incr} shows a smaller variation across the range of
segment sizes compared to using 20 points in \cref{fig:findStiffness_20incr}. The effect of both segment size and increment
size is especially evident for the two Spine 2 L1 vertebrae both intact and post
augmentation where the stiffness continues to increase until the end of the test
at 2000 N. Meaning that there is a much smaller linear region for these two
specimens, hence requiring a smaller segment size to measure the largest
gradient.

Choosing values for the segment size to use moving forwards becomes difficult
given the large effect it can have on the measured maximum stiffness (a range of
over 1000 N/mm in the case the two Spine 2 L1 tests). The segment size needs to
be small enough to capture the maximum stiffness while avoiding the noise when
using a segment size below 18 data points. Hence, a value of 20 data points was
chosen, a value that avoids the noise while being on the plateau of the lines.


\subsubsection{Repeated Loading}

Given the nature of the test (attempting to limit damage to the vertebrae)
especially during their initial intact load, the ability to derive errors
becomes difficult especially from a single load. To attempt to understand this
error four vertebrae having undergone augmentation were tested three more times
in an iterative fashion, removing each from the load testing machine, testing
the next specimen in the set and repeating. Removing the vertebrae from their
steel housing (instead of three tests while seated in the steel housing) allowed
the error in loading position and setup to be tested along with repeated loading
of the vertebrae to be tested.

The results of repeated loading can be seen in \cref{fig:exp_repeats}. All
four specimens show a reduced stiffness for the repeated loads following the
initial load, for which there are a few possible reasons. One possibility for
the reduction in stiffness is that it is a consequence of the freeze thaw cycle
that occurred between these tests. The second possibility is that the vertebrae
were still partially frozen while the testing took place. Finally, it could be
due to damage being caused during the initial load to 2000 N, shown in \cref{fig:Spine2_L1,fig:Spine3_L3} it is possible to see slight failure
in the three Spine 3 vertebrae, although failure cannot be seen in the Spine 2 L1
vertebrae. The frozen bar in \cref{fig:exp_repeats} shows how the
stiffness increases when the vertebrae are completely frozen, potentially
helping to explain the drop in stiffness found in the repeats. Further tests
will be carried out with three more repeats following another freeze thaw cycle
to attempt to answer this.

The iterative reduction in stiffness for the Spine 3 L2 vertebrae can be
explained as damage being caused after each iteration. This can be seen in
\cref{fig:Spine3_L2}, with the three repeats each showing a yielding
before the 1600 N limit and a smaller maximum load and stiffness after each
repeat.

Figures~\ref{fig:Spine2_L1} through~\ref{fig:Spine3_L3} show the data for the
loading, from which the maximum stiffness values are found. This excludes the
initial cyclic loading, starts the loading at 50 N and displacement at 0 mm.

\end{figure}






\subsection{Vertebroplasty}

Despite the development of methods for the augmentation of bovine tail
vertebrae, the methods for augmenting human vertebrae were altered due to the
different geometry and density. The human vertebrae, being much less dense, did
not require the vertebroplasty needle to be inserted with the aid of a mallet.
Instead the needle could be pushed by hand through the cortical shell and into
the vertebral body.

An additional difference was the approach with the needle, instead of entering
the vertebrae through their pedicles an oblique approach was adopted. This was
due to variation in pedicle diameter between the L1 - L5 lumbar levels and
therefore the potential to damage the region and its load sharing capabilities.
The oblique approach therefore avoided creating this damage to the pedicle-canal
region, especially for the vertebrae with narrower pedicles and instead created
much less damage to the vertebral body.
An illustration of this approach can be seen in \cref{fig:vp-ill} with an example $\mu$CT scan shown in \cref{fig:vp-ill_scan}.


\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=4in]{Chapters/Chapter_HT_images/vp_illustration.png}
  \caption{An illustration showing the approach to needle insertion and cement position.}
  \label{fig:vp-ill}
\end{figure}


\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=4in]{Chapters/Chapter_HT_images/vp_illustration_scan.png}
  \caption{A $\mu$CT scan showing the injected volume of cement at the anterior of the vertebral body with the cement track from the exiting needle to the right. For this specimen cement leaked through the anterior wall, limiting the quantity of cement injected.}
  \label{fig:vp-ill_scan}
\end{figure}

A final difference to the needle insertion methods was a change to the needle.
Here, a side opening needle was used, allowing the cement to be directed into
the anterior-centre region of the vertebral body as opposed to directly out of
the needle end.

It was attempted to inject the largest possible volumes of cement into the vertebrae, mimicking the clinical process.
Like the clinical procedure the injection was stopped upon cement leakage, which generally occurred through one of the vascular channels at either the posterior or anterior portions of the vertebrae.
However, despite stopping the injection upon cement leakage through vascular channels leading from the vertebral body surface inwards, cement loss occurred.
In addition to this, cement was also lost in the needle itself, where as the cement set the amount of cement remaining in the needle became difficult to measure.
This meant that the cement fill could not be measured though the amount of PMMA leaving the syringe due to leakage and needle losses.
Hence cement fill volume was measured using segmented $\mu$CT scans, the methodology of which is described below.

\subsection{Vertebrae Characteristics}

Identifying the different characteristics for the set of lumbar vertebrae has
importance in understanding trends and relationships between the experimental
and computational results. For example a larger degree of anisotropy and hence
more directionality aligned trabeculae would potentially give a more
experimentally stiff vertebra, despite otherwise similar characteristics. Given
that much of the vertebral characteristics depend on the trabecular structure it
is important to understand how this varies between specimens. Furthermore, any
calculations originating from a description of the trabecular structure require
a correct threshold to be applied to the $\mu$CT scan. This threshold describes
the limit of the trabecular bone and hence the start of either marrow or empty
space. To enable a fair comparison between vertebrae a region of interest was
selected from the vertebral body. Given the large variation in cortical shell
thickness, along with certain vertebrae containing large osteophytes and other
extra bone growth, the region of interest (ROI) was selected to be the largest
cylinder that could fit within the vertebral body while not capturing any of the
cortical shell.

\subsubsection{Histograms}

In order to understand the spread of brightness' from the set of lumbar the
histograms of the ROIs were plotted (\cref{fig:normalisedhistogram}).

\begin{figure}[ht!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=4in]{Chapters/Chapter_HT_images/Normalised_Histogram.png}
  \caption{The normalised (with respect to the volume of the ROI) histogram data
    for the 14 lumbar vertebrae.}
  \label{fig:normalisedhistogram}
\end{figure}

The lower greyscale values represent the empty space within the ROI which
translates to regions where the bone marrow has exited the region, most likely
during the freeze thaw cycles. The peak in the histogram at an approximate
greyscale value of 16 is due to the bone marrow. The remaining portion of the
histogram represents bone, where variation is due to the differences in the
mineral content of the bone, with more mineralised bone appearing brighter on
$\mu$CT scans. The specimens ROIs that contain the brighter values are those
that contain osteophytes that contain more dense bone than the other cortical
shell, for example Spine 2 L1.

\subsubsection{Threshold Optimisation}\label{th_opt}


The full resolution scan is imported into imageJ where the threshold optimisation is carried out.
The BoneJ plugin for imageJ is used for all of the trabecular structure metrics, with the optimise threshold tool being the focus here.
The threshold optimisation feature works by optimising the connectivity (Conn.D) against threshold value \autocite{Doubea2010}.
This tool is run on the region of interest using the default settings for the connectivity options seen in \cref{tab:bonej}.
This chooses a threshold based on the peak in a connectivity against threshold plot and reports that value.
These values can be seen in \cref{tab:optTH}, showing considerable across the range of vertebrae.
However, the differences in these suggested thresholds can grouped with the spine, for example: the G17 spine has a range between 15 to 17, while the G41 spine has a range between 18 to 20.
This promotes the idea that these differences are due to the bone mineralisation of the bone, especially given that the G17 spine is from a Female and G41 from a male.

However, given that the chosen value for the threshold will directly impact the reported metrics, a consistent value was chosen of 18. Using lower or higher values for the threshold usually results in the trabeculae being described as thicker or thinner respectively.
Hence, the difference in the mineralisation between specimens will still be captured when using a fixed threshold, given that the binary image will be down sampled before material properties are acquired.
The results in \cref{tab:bv_tv_anis} show the BV / TV data and degree of anisotropy values for the 14 specimens using the fixed threshold of 18.
Similar trends to what could be seen from the optimise threshold results can be seen in the BV/TV data, with grouping between the
spines evident.
The Spine 1 spine has a much lower bone volume fraction compared to the other spines, which suggests a more osteoporotic spine, most likely resulting in less stiff vertebra.

\section{Computational Methods}

The split between different modelling methods, computational and experimental is not terribly clear, given that computational methods are employed in the scanning and material property analysis described above.
However, the methods described in this section describe the process used to model non-augmented and augmented vertebrae, with associated sensitivity tests to understand the most appropriate approach to various aspects of the modelling process.




\subsection{Non-augmented Vertebrae Modelling Sensitivity Tests}\label{sec:non_aug_sens}

Given the aims of the project - to include the models generated here into a
larger set of vertebral models for use in statistical shape modelling, it is
useful to model the vertebrae in a scanner independent method. A method for
doing this (BV/TV modelling method) uses a full resolution scan with the bone
regions segmented using a threshold. This full resolution segmented scan is then
downsampled to voxels with edge length of 1 mm, meaning that each voxel has a
greyscale value proportional to the BV/TV value for the region captured by that
voxel. Areas that contain more bone will therefore have a higher greyscale
value. This method is purely dependant on the threshold selected defining the
bone and hence, given that threshold values can be repeatedly and correctly
selected with the methods shown in Section~\ref{th_opt}, it is scanner independent.

Other sensitivity studies present difficulties due to the models reliance on the underlying greyscale background.
This is due to the greyscale optimisation process required to obtain a new conversion factor between the greyscale values and the Young's modulus for every change made to the material properties or boundary conditions of the models.
This is in order to understand the effect the change has on the agreement between experimental and computational results, and because a change to the material properties or boundary conditions may not have a systematic or uniform effect on the results.
Due to this, simple sensitivity tests become difficult, including common convergence studies.

\subsubsection{BV/TV Modelling Method}\label{bvtv_method}

This method gives the opportunity to keep much of the detail that is often lost when downsampling image data.
Specifically, the method described gives the vertebral models much more definition of the cortical shell and internal trabecular structure while maintaining the 1 mm cubed resolution and the computational cost benefits associated with that.
The method follows that found in a study by Robson Brown et al.
\cite{RobsonBrown2014} with a few minor changes. The scans are converted from the ScanCo proprietary ISQ format into a stack of TIFF files using an in house Matlab script, which in additionally reduces reduces the 16 bit data to 8 bit images.

The set of vertebral specimens were split at this stage into two sets, allowing
an understanding of how the bone volume fraction method affects the results compared to the method described in Section~\ref{finite-element-modelling-methods}.
To the set using the bone volume fraction method a threshold was applied at the full 82 $\mu$m resolution.
This threshold was chosen to be a greyscale value of 18, the mean of the values described in section Section~\ref{th_opt} and was applied to the scan stacks in imageJ.
Once the binary stack was created a Gaussian filter was applied, also within imageJ, with $
\sigma_{x,y,z} = 1 $.
This was applied in order to remove speckling found surrounding the end-caps and some of the other noise visible in the scans.
The two stacks of images are then imported into ScanIP; carried
out by opening one stack of images (the original stack) and then importing a
second background (the binary image stack). Both backgrounds are downsampled to
voxel sizes of 1 mm$^3$, with the (originally) binary stack being used to create
the mask for the vertebrae and the original stack being used for the end-caps.
Greyscale material properties for the vertebral mask are taken from the binary
stack, while the remainder of the methods follow the same process as the
original method.
A comparison of the two approaches can be seen in \cref{fig:normal_vs_bv_tv_seg}, where the improved definition of trabecular structure and cortical shell using the bone volume fraction method can be seen in E and F.

%\subsubsection{Predicting Vertebral Yield Point}\label{predYield}

\subsubsection{Load Position Sensitivity}

In order to understand how the vertebrae respond to different loading positions, 16 different positions were tested, shown in \cref{fig:loading_pos}.
These positions included 1~mm and 2~mm aways from the centre in the posterior, anterior, left and right directions along with larger deviations of 10~mm and 20~mm from the centre in the same directions.
The same boundary conditions, along with the 1 mm of displacement described above were applied to the different loading positions and the change in stiffness was recorded.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{Chapters/Chapter_HT_images/Loading_positions_Human.png}
\caption{The loading positions used for the load variation tests. Position X is the original central loading position for ap and lr loading, other loading positions are 1~mm, 2~mm, 10~mm and 20~mm away from the centre.}
\label{fig:loading_pos}
\end{figure}


The results of the load position sensitivity tests (\cref{fig:hum_load_ap}) show that on average, small posterior loads (above denser bone) result in higher stiffness's while all anterior loads result in a reduced stiffness. Loads lateral to the central loading point (\cref{fig:hum_load_lr}) resulted in little mean change to the stiffness of the models for the 1 and 2~mm positions.
Larger movements away from the central loading position (10~mm and 20~mm) result in almost all vertebrae presenting a reduction in stiffness.
Loading positions at 20~mm left and right present the largest reductions, where in the body the expected loads are less compared to anterior/posterior loading.
Additionally, larger anterior loads resulted in larger reductions in the stiffness, given the less dense nature of anterior portions of the vertebral body

It also shows that the effect of movements of 1 mm away from the experimental loading position only changes the stiffness by approximately 5 \%.
Given the resolution of the models is limited to 1 mm, the accuracy of the selection of the experimental loading positions is also limited to 1 mm.
The maximum 5 \% change to the stiffness when posterior or anterior may describe some of the error seen when comparing the experimental and computational results.

\label{fig:hum_load_lr}
\end{figure}



\subsubsection{End-cap Depth \& Contact sensitivity}

The stress distribution at the surface of the vertebral body shows high stress at the edges of the cement endcaps, at both the top and bottom of these regions, shown in \cref{fig:stress_lines}.
Experimentally the endcaps are merely moulded to the shape of the top and bottom of the vertebral body, however, previous work and other studies have used tied contact between the bone and endcaps, removing any motion between the two and locking neighbouring nodes together.
Additionally, the depth of these endcaps varies between 5 mm and 20 mm depending on the shape of the vertebral endplates.
The more concave the vertebral endcap was the more cement was required to fill the space forming a flat cement surface.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.65\textwidth]{Chapters/Chapter_HT_images/stress_lines.pdf}
\caption{The effect of having tied contacts between the endcaps and the bone, with the increases in Von Mices stress indicated.}
\label{fig:stress_lines}
\end{figure}


Given this variation, tests identifying the effect of changing the endcap depth were carried out using FEA models with different depths of $\pm$ 1, $\pm$ 2 and $\pm$ 3 mm for the top and bottom endcaps independently and together.
Additionally, different interactions between the bone and cement endcaps were tested.
This included the current standard method of a tied interaction and replacing this with a frictionless contact between the two materials.
Finally, the effect of changing the cement endcap depth with the frictionless contact was also investigated, along with variations to the properties of the frictionless contacts.
This was carried out given that, experimentally, there is no tied contact between the PMMA and the bone due to the lack of adhesive properties for the PMMA.

The endcap depth was altered by adding and removing layers within the model file in ScanIP, re-meshing the model and running the files using the same Abaqus python scripts.
Endcap contacts were changed within the Abaqus python scripts, by firstly removing the ties between the endcap and the vertebra.
An interaction property was created with tangential behaviour set to frictionless and normal behavior with properties: $pressureOverclosure=HARD,  constraintEnforcementMethod=Default$ and the final option was experimented with, $allowSeperation=ON/OFF$.
The $allowSeperation$ variable determines whether separation is permitted once contact is established and models ran correctly with it set to its default of $ON$.
However, when experimenting with the effect of loading position, especially with loads applied far from the vertebral centre, the solver struggled to converge.
Disallowing separation after contact was shown to have a small effect on the results (the outputted stiffness) and allowed the models to run to the completion of the job.
The remaining settings were set to the default for a generic contact: 

$
	initialClearance=OMIT \\
	adjustMethod=None \\
	sliding=SMALL \\
	enforcement=NODE\_TO\_SURFACE \\
	thickness=ON \\
	supplementaryContact=SELECTIVE \\
	interactionProperty=contactName \\
	smooth=0.2 \\
	bondingSet=None \\
$

The results shown in \cref{fig:with,fig:without} show that regardless of the contact, increasing the depth of the endcaps significantly increases the stiffness of the vertebrae, while reducing the depth reduces the measured stiffness.
The effect this extra or reduced constraint caused by the changing endcap depth broadly follows the same trends for the two vertebrae tested.
However, the response does differ most notably at the extremes of endcap depths ($\pm$3 mm), where the spine 4 L5 vertebrae experiences the greater reduction in stiffness when reducing the endcap depth, while the spine 1 L2 vertebrae sees the greater increase following depth increases.
This difference is a consequence of the differences in the density of the vertebrae (where spine 4 is, on average, much denser than spine 1 in terms of mean greyscale value) and the differences in the shape (the L5 vertebrae being much wider with greater protruding bone spurs at the bottom of the vertebrae and the narrower L2 vertebrae having the bone spurs at the top of the vertebrae.
These shape differences can be seen in \cref{fig:Spine 1_projection,fig:Spine 4_projection}.

The variation in the change to the stiffness within $\pm$ 1mm change in depth was up to 5 \%, for both cases.
Given that the maximum error in masking the cement endcaps is 0.5 mm due to the resolution that is used for the segmentation, it suggests that this error has a minimal effect on the end results.

The effect of changing the contact from tied to frictionless can be seen by comparing \cref{fig:with,fig:without}.
Excluding the very large change in stiffness seen in the L5 vertebra when reducing the depth of the inferior endcap, the adoption of the frictionless contact between endcap and vertebrae means that the effect of endcap depth on measured stiffness is reduced.
This is due to a reduction in the constraining nature of the frictionless contact.
The anomalous L5 vertebrae here is a function of having less support and the slipping that this allowed, resulting in the reduced measured stiffness.
Optimising the greyscale conversion factor for the set of models with a tied constraint and a frictionless contact gave concordance correlation coefficients of 0.848 and 0.865 respectively.
Therefore the frictionless contact providing a small improvement in the agreement between the computational and experimental results.

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Chapters/Chapter_HT_images/with.pdf}
\caption{The percentage change in stiffness following a change to the endcap thickness. Inf and Sup show changes of $\pm$ 1, 2 and 3 mm to the inferior and superior endcap depth respectively. The endcaps have a tied contact to the vertebrae.}

\end{figure}

\label{fig:without}
\end{figure}

Further tuning of the specifics of the frictionless contact could be carried out to see if an improved agreement could be achieved would be a simple addition to this sensitivity test.
However, due to the greyscale conversion factor optimisation process required to test each option this would be a timely operation, which, given the minimal effect of changing to the frictionless contact, could yield negligible results.




\subsection{Material Properties}

The general method for getting material properties for the bone elements in the FE models uses the same approach as used in \cref{material-properties-bov} where the Young's modulus of each element is equal to the greyscale value multiplied by a conversion factor.
The conversion factor is optimised by comparing the computational stiffness against the experimentally acquired stiffness.
For the optimisation process the vertebrae were split into two groups at random, giving a calibration and validation set, allowing a test of the validity of the greyscale conversion factor.
The split of the vertebrae for these two sets can be seen in \cref{tab:calib_valid}.

\begin{table}[ht!]
	\caption{The vertebrae used for the calibration set and the validation set in the optimisation process.}
	\label{tab:calib_valid}
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{c|c}
    Calibration Set   & Validation Set  \\ \hline \hline
    Spine 1 L4 & Spine 1 L1  \\
    Spine 1 L5 & Spine 1 L2\\
    Spine 2 L1 & Spine 1 L3 \\
    Spine 3 L2 & Spine 3 L1\\
    Spine 4 L1 & Spine 3 L3\\
    Spine 4 L2 & Spine 4 L3\\
    Spine 4 L4 & Spine 4 L5 \\
    \hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}


Results from the initial optimisation process using the calibration and validation processes gave good results, in that the agreement of the validation set had CCC values of above 0.5.
The validation set for the ``normal" method had a CCC value of 0.591 and the CCC value for the validate set from the ``bone volume fraction" method gave a value of 0.831.

Given the problems associated with calculating the greyscale conversion factor with various sensitivity tests described in \cref{sec:non_aug_sens}, the calibration and validation sets were only used for the initial test, once using the ``normal" method and once using the ``bone volume fraction" method.
This validated the use of the optimisation process while allowing more accurate greyscale conversion factors for the sensitivity tests and final values given that the input set of human vertebrae was relatively small.

Following the results of the sensitivity tests the final value from the optimisation process for the greyscale conversion factor was 0.0009625.
This was used for the bone properties for all final non-augmented models and augmented models.

The remaining material properties used for all of the models are a Poisson's ration of 0.3 for the bone and endcaps and a Young's modulus of 2.45~GPa for the endcaps. 

\subsection{Modelling Augmentation}

Given the limited validation of models achieved using bovine tail vertebrae (due to the reasons discussed in Section~\ref{bov:results}), a range of different material properties and approaches to modelling the bone-cement interface were investigated.
In addition to varying the material properties of the injected volumes of cement, the effect of using a combination of scans from before and after augmentation has been experimented with.
To achieve this scans of pre/post augmentation were registered.
This method utilised the BV/TV method described earlier, where the non-augmented full resolution thresholded scan is registered to the full resolution augmented scan.

\subsubsection{Registration of $\mu$CT Scans}

Artificial brightening of regions surrounding the internal cement (specifically the concentrated volumes of barium sulphate and the artefacts associated) affect the material properties that are applied to the material, seen in the right-hand image in \cref{fig:reg_demo}.
To bypass this effect the two models, intact and post-augmentation models can be registered - translating them into the same spacial location.
This allows the cement to be defined, masked and modelled based on the post-augmentation scan and the remaining vertebra to be defined from the intact scan, the same background used for the intact models.
While the shape of the vertebra may have been changed over the course of its two loads, this change is less than what can be seen at 1 mm resolution and is not apparent during the registration process carried out at 82 $\mu$m resolution.
Additionally regions that have experienced damage through the insertion of the needle, yet do not contain cement, will also be neglected using this method.
However, the same justification can be made, where this is unlikely to have any affect at 1 mm resolution.

Registration of the images was carried out in 3D Slicer, using scans of the segmented, full-resolution, non-augmented vertebrae and the full-resolution augmented vertebral scans.
The method of registration was a landmark based approach using three landmarks for each vertebra, translating the scan of the augmented vertebrae.
These points were selected at superior of one pedicle, the inferior of the other pedicle and the inferior anterior of the vertebral body.
The selection of these points proved to provide a repeatable registration of the vertebrae, without selecting superfluous landmarks.
Once registered the resulting translated augmented vertebrae scan was cropped with respect to the non-augmented scan to provide an aligned and registered pair of scans.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=4in]{Chapters/Chapter_HT_images/reg_demo.png}
  \caption{An illustration of the registration process, registering the non-augmented scan (left) with the augmented scan (right). The images are at 1 mm resolution, showing the artifacts created by the barium sulphate when viewed at this resolution, while to increase accuracy the registration carried out in Slicer 3D was at the full 82 $\mu$m resolution.}
  \label{fig:reg_demo}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Registered Scan Model Generation}

The augmented models using the registered scans were created in ScanIP, following similar methods to the bone volume fraction method described in Section~\ref{bvtv_method}.
The initial step was to import the registered augmented scans and apply an initial downsample to a resolution of 0.5 mm$^3$.
This resolution provided enough detail to capture the detail of the injected cement volume without increasing the computational difficulty and therefore time to segment the scans.

To segment the three regions (background, bone and endcaps, and injected cement) it was found that the most reproducible and accurate method was to use the Otsu thresholding process \cite{sezgin2004survey}, a filter that is built in to ScanIP\@.
It was used to find three masks in the scan and works on a threshold clustering method.
In this case searching for four clusters or masks separated by different thresholds and returning a mask that described the background, the bone and endcaps and the cement region.
From this only the cement mask was retained and underwent a flood fill filter, removing empty voxels found within the description of the mask.
The mask and background were then downsampled to 1 mm resolution and cropped to the same dimensions as the non-augmented model.
From the non-augmented model, the masked describing the vertebra, the endcaps and the background of the vertebra where imported.
The origin of the masks coming from the two backgrounds can be seen in \cref{fig:mask_demo}.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=4in]{Chapters/Chapter_HT_images/mask_demo.png}
  \caption{An illustration showing the origin of the masks from the non-augmented scan (left) and the augmented scan (right).}
  \label{fig:mask_demo}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Cement Volume Material Property Tests}

Based on the results of the tests carried out on the bovine tail vertebrae in \cref{chap_bov}, different material properties and approaches were attempted to further the agreement between the experimental and computational results of augmented vertebrae.
These were mainly changing the material properties of the interface layer between the bone and the cement, along with the material properties of the cement volume itself.

A different approach to modelling the cement region was also attempted.
This used an inverse greyscale material property for the cement region, rather than a homogeneous material property for the region, based on the greyscale background of the non-augmented vertebral scans with the mask from the augmented models overlaid.
This meant that darker regions of greyscale (within the cement volume) would be given a Young's modulus of PMMA cement (2.4 GPa) which would decrease linearly to the Young's modulus of the bone when entering into the brighter regions of the greyscale background.
Representing the cement regions using this method meant that the underlying bone present inside the cement volumes is not ignored, instead the interdigitation between bone and cement in represented.
While this representation is potentially inaccurate, it provides more detail that using a homogeneous material property and more detail than van be seen on the augmented vertebral scans.

The relationship for the cement volume using this method was therefore:
\begin{equation}
	E(\rho) = \alpha \rho + c
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	E(\rho) = -0.00842 \rho + 2.4
\end{equation}

Where $\rho$ is the greyscale value of each voxel and $E$ is the Young's modulus of each element within the cement region.
This ensured that the Young's modulus of the regions containing no bone (greyscale = 0)  was equal to that of the cement and regions containing bone (greyscale = 255) had a Young's modulus equal to 250 MPa, an approximate value for trabecular bone, with a linear relationship between.

Following the results of the above tests, the final material properties and boundary conditions for the augmented models are below.

The material properties for the yielding interface are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item 1 mm thick layer surrounding the cement volume (ScanIP dilate)
	\item Young's modulus =  0.01 MPa
	\item Poisson's ration = 0.4
	\item Yield stress = 5 Pa, upon which it becomes perfectly plastic
\end{itemize}

The material properties for the cement volume are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Young's modulus =  1.7 GPa
	\item Poisson's ration = 0.4
\end{itemize}

Boundary conditions for the cement region include: tie contacts between the vertebrae and interface, and between the interface and the cement volume.
The remaining material properties and boundary conditions remain the same as with the non-augmented models.

\subsection{Measuring the Vertebral Body \& Augmentation Volume}

While the volume of the vertebral mask can be measured directly within ScanIP or Abaqus, this volume includes the remainder of the pedicles.
The size of the pedicles that remain after their removal during dissection varies between level and spine and is especially different with the level five vertebra, where the shape and size varies dramatically.
To account for this variation and to get a more accurate cement fill percentage for the augmented models elliptic cylinders were fitted to the vertebral body as shown in \cref{fig:cyl_fit}.



\begin{figure}[ht!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=5in]{Chapters/Chapter_HT_images/cyl_fit_ful_iso_both.png}
  \caption{A diagram showing the fitting of the cylinders to the vertebral body, where the point cloud describing the vertebra comes from an STL file, the red ring shows the points included in the mid-slice and the central red dot indicates the center of the mid-slice.}
  \label{fig:cyl_fit}
\end{figure}

Vertebrae that contained a vascular channel, seen in \cref{fig:cyl_channel}, had the channel removed by filling the space in ScanIP.
This was carried out for two main reasons: the first was to allow accurate fitting of the cylinder into the vertebral (to avoid the problems shown in \cref{fig:cyl_channel}) and to remove problems with the cement being exposed when modelling augmentation and the extra contacts / interfaces that are created.
Models with the vascular channel removed were compared to the original models and it was found that there was less than 0.5 \% difference for the set.
This was due to the elements used to fill the channel having material properties based on the greyscale, which had values of approximately zero, given the nature of the channel.
Due to the lack of any effect in removing the channel the vertebra models of augmentation did not include the vascular channel.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=5in]{Chapters/Chapter_HT_images/cyl_fit_channel_both.png}
  \caption{An illustration showing the problems that occur with vertebrae that have a distinctive vascular channel and the false cylinder fit that occurs.}
  \label{fig:cyl_channel}
\end{figure}

This was carried out using a set of scripts written in python and rely of having stl files describing the vertebral geometry.
The scripts work by finding the middle slice of a set of nodes that describe the vertebra.
From the middle slice the shape of the ellipse is formed.
Given that the alignment of the vertebrae is uniform, the mid point on the $y$ axis is found by searching for the node furthest away from the weighted center, $\pm$ 2 mm of the weighted centre.
This gives the $a$ measure of the ellipse description.
The $b$ measure is found by using a similar process - searching for the node furthest away from the centre on the $x$ axis, within $\pm$ 2 mm.
The $a$ and $b$ measures gave the shape of the ellipse and the height of the elliptic cylinder was found by raising and lowering the ellipse until a node in the middle $\pm$ 5 mm intersected the ellipse.
This defined the height of the ellipse.
The volume of the ellipse was found (V = $\pi a b h$, where $a$ and $b$ have been described and $h$ is the height) and compared to that of the total vertebral volume, shown in \cref{tab:vertebrae_vol_cyl}.
The percentage reduction in vertebral body volume, from total vertebral body volume to the fitted cylinder volume, varies significantly and is due to changes to the vertebral shape outside of the main vertebral body portion.
For example, Spine 2 L1 was a degenerate vertebrae with extra bone growth at the anterior limits of the vertebral body.
Other large changes were due to the size of the pedicles, where larger vertebrae (Spine 4) had proportionally larger pedicles.

\end{table}

The effect of this change on the relationship between cement fill and change in augmentation stiffness was identified and is shown in \cref{fig:cyl_fit_comparison}.
While there was a change in the relationship, a clear trend between the cement fill percentage and change in stiffness for the majority of the vertebrae is still not evident without including other factors (described in \cref{sec:aug_stiffness_res}).

\section{Results}


\subsection{Experimental Properties}\label{sec:aug_stiffness_res}

Material properties for the vertebrae can be seen in \cref{tab:bv_tv_anis}, with grouping evident for the bone volume fraction measurements.
For example the mean BV/TV value for Spine 1 was $0.159 \pm 0.026$, while the mean for Spine 4 was $0.248 \pm 0.022$ with similar results for the other two spines (although with less vertebra).
Less grouping could be seen between the degree of anisotropy for the vertebrae.

The vertebral stiffness following experimental loading can be seen in \cref{tab:aug_non_aug_stiff} for the non-augmented vertebrae and following vertebral augmentation.
The change in stiffness can be seen in \cref{fig:aug_non_aug_stiffness} where an increase in stiffness was seen Spine 1 L2-L5 and Spine 2 L1, while the remaining vertebrae presented a reduction in stiffness following augmentation.

  \label{fig:aug_non_aug_stiffness}

A strong relationship was found between the percentage fill achieved and the bone volume fraction of the vertebra, where a reduced density of bone resulted in larger quantities of cement being injected into the vertebra before cement leakage occurred.
This relationship can be seen in \cref{fig:cmt_fill_vs_bvtv}.

There was not a clear relationship found between the cement fill of the total vertebral volume and the resulting change in stiffness following augmentation for the set of vertebrae on the whole.
However, trends could be seen when splitting vertebrae into groups with: \textit{a)} dispersed volumes of injected cement and \textit{b)} concentrated volumes of cement.
This can be seen in \cref{fig:aug_cmt_fill_vs_ch_stiff} where a trend ($r=0.83$) can be seen between the percentage fill of the total vertebral volume and the percentage change in stiffness for those vertebrae with concentrated volumes of cement.

\subsubsection{Non-augmented Model Results}

The results of modelling the non-augmented vertebrae can be seen in \cref{fig:intact_norm_bvtv}, comparing the initial normal method (the method used with the bovine tail vertebra in the previous chapter) with the best case using the bone volume fraction method and the results of the sensitivity test described previously.
The results show a large improvement using the results of the sensitivity tests and the bone volume fraction method, with a concordance correlation coefficient improving from 0.55 to 0.86.

\section{Discussion}





\subsection{Experimental Results}

Experimentally there was large variation seen in the results, in terms of
material properties (BV/TV values), geometry and response to loading.  The
experimental response to loading showed a large range in the stiffness of the
vertebrae, even for vertebrae with similar volumes and for vertebrae
originating from the same spine.  This wide range of stiffness' extends to the
augmented vertebral stiffness, although the range does decrease following
augmentation.  The variation seen in the intact vertebrae aids the
justification for the study, if such a wide range of vertebral properties
exists within such a small data set then it explains why such variation is
found clinically when identifying the response to vertebroplasty.

Following augmentation five of the 14 vertebrae showed an increase in the
stiffness following augmentation, which, given the stiffness of the injected
cement compared to that of trabecular bone, is an unexpectedly small number.
Four of the vertebrae that showed an increase in stiffness were from the same
spine (Spine 1), which is the spine that had a considerably smaller bone volume
fraction compared to the other vertebra from other spines.  Given that this
spine had the smallest bone volume fraction it also received the largest
quantity of cement, given the relationship between the percentage fill achieved
and the bone volume fraction.  This relationship is most likely due to the ease
of cement injection before leakage, with more dense vertebrae failing to
receive large volumes of cement before the cement found one of the vascular
channels (upon which injection was stopped) and less dense vertebrae having
more space to receive cement.

Cement volume positions were generally to the anterior of the vertebrae and to
the middle of the inferior-superior plane, matching the desired position
achieved through the insertion of the needle and angling of the side opening
needle tip.  Given the lack of obvious variation in cement positions and shapes
it was difficult to characterise the cement distributions, hence, a simplified
description of the cement was used.  This simplified description of the cement
described whether the cement was in a concentrated volume or dispersed in a
larger region or whole vertebra.  Following this characterisation strong
relationships were found between the change in stiffness and percentage fill,
if only those vertebrae with a concentrated volume of cement were included.
Suggesting that distributed volumes of cement are difficult to predict and
should be avoided when carrying out the procedure using fluoroscopy, especially
with more dense vertebrae where the likelihood or disperse volumes of cement
increased.


To summarise the change in stiffness following augmentation based on the
material properties of the vertebrae, the following features have the greatest
effect:
\begin{enumerate} 
\item A smaller bone volume fraction results in larger quantities of cement
    being injected before leakage occurs.  
\item If the volume of cement is contained in a concentrated volume then the
    greater the volume of cement then the larger the increase in stiffness
    following augmentation.  
\item If the volume of cement is dispersed through the
    vertebral body then there is no relationship between the volume of cement
    injected and its effect of the vertebral stiffness.
\item Concentrated volumes of cement are more likely if the bone volume
fraction of the vertebra is smaller.
\end{enumerate}

The effects of vertebral geometry and material properties on the response to
augmentation will be investigated further using statistical shape modelling in
\cref{PCA_CHAP}, giving a more detailed story of the suggested approaches to
vertebroplasty based on the tests carried out in this study.

\subsection{Limitations Regarding Specimen Numbers \& Vertebral Features}

One of the main limitations to the study is the numbers of vertebrae included
in in the set.  Having four human spines with a limited number of lumbar
vertebrae available from each spine, meant that only 14 out of a possible 20
vertebrae were able to be tested.  This meant that there was a skew towards the
top of the lumbar section with limited numbers of L4 and L5 vertebrae.  Such
skews to the data set have effects to any statistics applied to the data set
and will be discussed more thoroughly in the PCA discussion chapter in
Section~\ref{pca_disc}.  More relevant to modelling the vertebrae is the effect
this has on the determination and optimisation of the greyscale conversion
factor.  The large change in geometry from L4 to L5, rather that the gradual
change between L1 to L4, introduces questions about the response to loading
(and augmentation) for this vertebra in particular and how it differs from
other levels.  A resolution to this limitation would be to increase the
specimen numbers and look at vertebral levels in isolation; identifying level
specific differences and properties.  Variation at different vertebral levels
may require level specific greyscale conversion factors, such as those required
when modelling different animal species \cite{zapata2017methodology}.  However,
within the current set of vertebrae greater variation was found between spine
rather than level (for BV/TV, stiffness and vertebral body volume), even when
including L5 vertebrae.  Suggesting that segregation of vertebral levels is
unnecessary for the current specimen set. 

Another limitation of the study is the age range and limited information
regarding vertebral health.  Because of this unknown vertebral quality or
health it was decided to skip the initial load to failure carried out in the
bovine tail study.  While no evidence of fractures could be seen in the $\mu$CT
scans, other than slight wedge shapes, there was no evidence of the bovine tail
vertebrae having succumbed to fracture in $\mu$CT either, despite clear
fractures on load displacement curves.  Therefore the state of the vertebrae
was relatively unknown pre-augmentation and the study therefore becomes an
investigation into the effects of prophylactic vertebroplasty, although with
the possibility that some of the vertebrae were fractured \textit{in vivo}.




\subsection{Computational Results}

The improvement in the agreement between computational stiffness and the
experimental stiffness results using the bone volume fraction method and the
results of the sensitivity tests is significant and provided a good foundation
for modelling the more challenging augmented models.  The improvement using the
bone volume fraction method in isolation (without the results of the other
sensitivity tests) showed a large improvement over the normal method.  The
normal method performed similarly on the bovine tail vertebrae as with the
human lumbar vertebrae, with a CCC = 0.49 for bovine tail vertebrae and CCC =
0.55 for the human vertebrae. 

The improved agreement of modelling the human vertebrae over the bovine
vertebrae when using the same ``normal" method suggests that either the human
vertebrae are more receptive to the modelling method used, or that the
experimental procedure was more repeatable and therefore provided more accurate
results. One possibility is that the less narrow human vertebrae provided an
easier material to load axially, with slight off axis loads causing the
vertebrae to not be seated in the endcaps correctly in the case of the bovine
tail vertebrae. This sensitivity to endcap contact properties was shown earlier
and potentially given the tendency of the bovine vertebrae to be loaded
non-axially they may be more sensitive to such endcap contact properties. So,
while experimentally the bovine vertebrae were able to slip in the endcaps,
computationally the two materials were tied, restricting this ability and
reducing the agreement with the experiment. Conversely, the wider human
vertebrae had less of a tendency to slip and were less sensitive to the endcap
contact.

The improvement using the bone volume fraction method is most likely due to the
added definition of the trabecular bone and cortical shell, especially given
how important the correct representation of load sharing is for accurate models
\cite{eswaran2006cortical}. This agreement is much stronger than the agreement
found in similar studies that used a comparable methodology to the ``normal"
method \cite{Wijayathunga2008, zapata2017methodology, RobsonBrown2014} and
comparable to methods that used more complex though individual material
properties for each model \cite{Kinzl2012,kinzl2013experimentally}.  Having
greater definition of the cortical shell and trabecular bone alignment allows
much more accurate descriptions of the load transfer through the vertebrae,
rather than the more simple description with the more homogenised material
properties of the normal method.

This method also removed any effect that the bone marrow, where, given the
freeze/thaw cycles the marrow leaks from the vertebrae giving vertebral scans
with portions of the bone marrow missing and therefore changing the greyscale
background and material properties.  Due to the initial segmentation at 82
$\mu$m using the BV/TV method the bone marrow is not present in the segmented
full resolution or downsampled scans and therefore has no impact on the
material properties of the models.  Conversely, using the normal method, areas
lacking bone marrow would have a lower Young's modulus and areas with bone
marrow would have higher Young's moduli, not corresponding to the actual
properties of these regions and changing the load distribution.

One of the limitations of the bone volume fraction method is that is relies on
having trabecular resolution scans of the vertebrae to apply the trabecular
bone thresholds to.  This limits the origin of the scans to \textit{in vitro}
scans rather than \textit{in vivo} scans where the resolution is limited to
approximately 1 mm and larger.  Given the intention to generate larger
populations of vertebra models for use in statistical shape modelling this
limit to scan origin is an unwanted consequence.  A possible solution to this
problem would be to use 16 bit images rather than the currently used 8 bit
images.  This change gives an increase in the number of greyscale values
available from the 256 of 8-bit images to over 65,000 for 16-bit images.  The
main benefit of the bone volume fraction method is the increased definition of
bone structure and a greater contrast between the brighter, denser cortical
bone, the trabecular bone and the empty, non-bone areas.  Using 16-bit images
along with image manipulation to change the contrast of the scans may allow the
added detail and contrast to be captured with relatively low ($\geq$ 1 mm)
resolution scans, therefore greatly increasing the number of vertebral
specimens available for use.



The results of modelling augmented vertebrae showed a reduction in the
agreement when compared to the non-augmented vertebral models.  Reasons for
this are centred around modelling the internal cement volume, given the good
agreement seen between the non-augmented vertebrae and their models.  More
specifically the problems in modelling the cement region within models may be
due to experimental and modelling techniques.  Issues surrounding the
experimental work are the difficulty in capturing the extent of the
augmentation volume, often due to clumping of the barium sulphate and
separation of the barium sulphate from the other components of the PMMA cement.
While this problem is minimised through segmentation of the cement region at
higher resolutions before the downsampling, a problem still lies in capturing
the intricate interdigitation between the cement and the trabecular bone at a
resolution of 1 mm.  An additional experimental challenge is the unknown level
of damage caused to the vertebrae when the needle is inserted.  Given that
after clear fractures (based on load-displacement curves) could not be seen on
82 $\mu$m scans of bovine tail vertebrae, it is unlikely that micro-fractures
caused through needle insertion will be captured in the $\mu$CT scans of the
human vertebrae.

Despite the reduced agreement of the augmented models, there was a large
improvement compared to the initial method, which was the method used for
modelling augmentation in the bovine tail vertebrae.  As with the non-augmented
models the CCC using the initial method was very similar to the CCC using the
similar method on the bovine tail vertebrae, CCC = 0.18 and 0.15 for the human
and bovine models respectively.  This makes the improvement using the
registration significant and a beneficial step in making the models.

Achieving improved agreement between the computation and experimental models is
an obvious next step for the project and despite the range of approaches used
and attempted to improve the agreement, there are some next steps.  Given the
difficulty capturing the detail between the cement and trabecular bone, using a
higher resolution is a clear next step.  However, it comes with a number of
difficulties which have been shown in the study by Zhao et al. \cite{Zhao2012},
where the increase in resolution presents many other unknowns that need to be
modelled.  For example modelling the specific interaction between the bone and
the cement including the  coefficient of friction between them.  This would
require difficult experimental investigations, given the unique environment
inside the vertebrae filled with bone marrow.  Along with modelling properties
that are not applicable in continuum level models, there is the problem with
computational cost, where the increased time to solve models would become
problematic given the investigatory nature of the study and the fact that the
behaviour in simplified bone plug models is different to what is seen in whole
vertebrae \cite{Sikora2013}.

\subsubsection{Sensitivity Test Significance}

The use of the bone volume fraction method provided the most important increase in the agreement between computational and experimental results of stiffness for non-augmented models.
Load position

EC depth / contact

Sources of error from the modelling side come from discrepancies between the
experimental setup and specimen geometry. Sensitivity tests carried out
identified the effect of errors in accurately describing the cement cap depth
and loading position accuracy, given the 1~mm accuracy limit. The maximum
possible error for load position in a $\pm$1~mm anterior/posterior direction
was less than 5\%, with the worst case error for the for the encap depth tests
(1~mm thicker for both endcaps) being approximately 5\%. Other possible errors
would include accurately capturing the model geometry, however simply eroding
or dilating the vertebral mesh would not accurately describe the type of
meshing errors that may occur (it is unlikely that masks would be created at
$\pm$ 1 voxel around the whole model). To attempt to answer this a user
variability test was carried out in \cref{sec:uvs}. There, the maximum user
variability gave errors of 14 \%, however as discussed in that chapter, users
achieved consistently higher or lower stiffness' compared to their peers.
Hence, a 14 \% error within a single users segmentation process is both
unlikely and further reduced through the use of the python script carrying out
the thresholding and morphological filters to segment the model.
