\section{Introduction}

Previous studies and earlier chapters have used a range of vertebrae, including bovine, ovine and porcine among others. While all of these vertebrae have important uses for developing methodology and understanding certain characteristics, none share the trabecular structure, thickness of cortical shell, axial strength of stiffness. Hence, in order to understand the mechanical effects of vertebroplasty, human tissue is required.

Here, 14 lumbar vertebrae from four cadaveric spines have been used, with the details shown in \cref{tab:vertebrae}.

\section{Experimental Methods}

\subsection{Dissection \& Potting}

The geometry of human lumbar vertebrae varies considerably to that of the bovine
tail vertebrae from which this methodology is based. This is characterised by
much larger posterior elements with the facets extending much lower, below the
bottom of the vertebral body. Hence, to correctly pot the human vertebrae much
more cement must be used, especially for the posterior end-cap, in order to
cover the bottom of the vertebral body and the extending posterior elements.
This means that much more of the posterior elements are constrained, therefore
restricting the rotation of the vertebral body endplates under axial load. In
addition to this the larger posterior elements which are captured within the
PMMA end-caps will transmit load and take a greater share of the load when
compared to the bovine tail vertebrae. Given that vertebroplasty attempts to
restore the stiffness of the vertebral body and that there is no understanding
of specifically how the loads are shared between the vertebral body and
posterior element, this presents a problem.

A solution to this is to remove the posterior elements, following such methods
as \cite{Wijayathunga2008,RobsonBrown2014}, where only the vertebral body is
modelled. This allows the stiffness of the vertebral body alone to be captured
and modelled. The posterior elements were removed by cutting through the
pedicles at the narrowest part, limiting damage to the region.

To pot the specimens that now lack a spinal canal, a retort stand was used to
hold the vertebra, ensuring that both endplates were level on average. The
specimen was then lowered down into the potting container leaving 5 mm between
the bottom of the vertebra and the container. PMMA was poured into the container
until the entire of the endplate was touching cement, with the edges of the
vertebral body covered. Care needed to be taken to ensure all of the endplate
was in contact with cement, given the extent of osteophytes creating non-flat
surfaces in some of the more degenerated specimens. The other side of the
vertebra was potted in a similar manner, however, due to the constraints of the
potting container a measured quantity of cement was poured prior to lowering the
vertebra into it. A spirit level ensured parallel end-caps.

\subsection{Loading}

Following previous studies \cite{Wijayathunga2008}, the vertebrae were loaded
with an initial maximum load of 800 N for similarly osteoporotic vertebrae.
However, after loading two of the initial set of vertebrae the stiffness
continued to increase up to maximum 800 N. Following loads up to 2000 N showed
that the stiffness reached a maximum between 1300 and 2000 N, with three of the
initial four specimens showing some degree of failure in the final 400 N of
loading.

\subsubsection{Maximum Stiffness Measurement}

The maximum stiffness of the vertebra was found in the same fashion as with the
bovine tail vertebrae - measuring the stiffness of segments at increments over
the length of the curve. Given that damage, especially for the intact specimens,
needs to be avoided the maximum loads used are on the conservative side. This
can mean that the maximum stiffness is potentially at the end of the data set or
that the stiffness is still increasing at the load cut off. The solution to the
latter would require a prediction of the yield point prior to experimental
loading (discussed in Section~\ref{predYield}), while the former could
potentially be solved by using smaller segment sizes when measuring the
stiffness from load - displacement results.

To allow the effect of segment size (the length of each section from which the
stiffness is found) and increment size (the size of each increment defining the
start point of each segment), the maximum stiffness finding Matlab code was
rewritten in Python. This function could then be iterated over, reporting the
maximum stiffness when using an increment size of between 1 and 100 data points
(the distance between two data points corresponds to 0.0017 mm). Changing the
increment size becomes a verification of the results using an increment size of
1 data point, given that the only negative of using the smallest possible
increment size is computational cost, which is negligible here.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=6in]{Chapters/Chapter_HT_images/findStiffness_1incr.png}
  \caption{The effect of reducing the segment size on the maximum stiffness
    reported from four human vertebrae loaded to 2000 N pre and post
    augmentation. Using an increment size of 1 data point (0.0017 mm) and
    segment sizes of 100 to 1 data point (0.17 mm to 0.0017 mm).}
  \label{fig:findStiffness_1incr}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[ht!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=6in]{Chapters/Chapter_HT_images/findStiffness_20incr.png}
  \caption{The effect of reducing the segment size on the maximum stiffness
    reported from four human vertebrae loaded to 2000 N pre and post
    augmentation. Using an increment size of 20 data points (0.0037 mm) and
    segment sizes of 100 to 1 data point (0.17 mm to 0.0017 mm).}
  \label{fig:findStiffness_20incr}
\end{figure}

Using an increment size of 1 data points width, as shown in \cref{fig:findStiffness_1incr} shows a smaller variation across the range of
segment sizes compared to using 20 points in \cref{fig:findStiffness_20incr}. The effect of both segment size and increment
size is especially evident for the two Spine 2 L1 vertebrae both intact and post
augmentation where the stiffness continues to increase until the end of the test
at 2000 N. Meaning that there is a much smaller linear region for these two
specimens, hence requiring a smaller segment size to measure the largest
gradient.

Choosing values for the segment size to use moving forwards becomes difficult
given the large effect it can have on the measured maximum stiffness (a range of
over 1000 N/mm in the case the two Spine 2 L1 tests). The segment size needs to
be small enough to capture the maximum stiffness while avoiding the noise when
using a segment size below 18 data points. Hence, a value of 20 data points was
chosen, a value that avoids the noise while being on the plateau of the lines.


\subsubsection{Repeated Loading}

Given the nature of the test (attempting to limit damage to the vertebrae)
especially during their initial intact load, the ability to derive errors
becomes difficult especially from a single load. To attempt to understand this
error four vertebrae having undergone augmentation were tested three more times
in an iterative fashion, removing each from the load testing machine, testing
the next specimen in the set and repeating. Removing the vertebrae from their
steel housing (instead of three tests while seated in the steel housing) allowed
the error in loading position and setup to be tested along with repeated loading
of the vertebrae to be tested.

The results of repeated loading can be seen in \cref{fig:exp_repeats}. All
four specimens show a reduced stiffness for the repeated loads following the
initial load, for which there are a few possible reasons. One possibility for
the reduction in stiffness is that it is a consequence of the freeze thaw cycle
that occurred between these tests. The second possibility is that the vertebrae
were still partially frozen while the testing took place. Finally, it could be
due to damage being caused during the initial load to 2000 N, shown in \cref{fig:Spine 2_L1,fig:Spine 3_L3} it is possible to see slight failure
in the three Spine 3 vertebrae, although failure cannot be seen in the Spine 2 L1
vertebrae. The frozen bar in \cref{fig:exp_repeats} shows how the
stiffness increases when the vertebrae are completely frozen, potentially
helping to explain the drop in stiffness found in the repeats. Further tests
will be carried out with three more repeats following another freeze thaw cycle
to attempt to answer this.

The iterative reduction in stiffness for the Spine 3 L2 vertebrae can be
explained as damage being caused after each iteration. This can be seen in
\cref{fig:Spine 3_L2}, with the three repeats each showing a yielding
before the 1600 N limit and a smaller maximum load and stiffness after each
repeat.

Figures~\ref{fig:Spine 2_L1} through~\ref{fig:Spine 3_L3} show the data for the
loading, from which the maximum stiffness values are found. This excludes the
initial cyclic loading, starts the loading at 50 N and displacement at 0 mm.

\end{figure}






\subsection{Vertebroplasty}

Despite the development of methods for the augmentation of bovine tail
vertebrae, the methods for augmenting human vertebrae were altered due to the
different geometry and density. The human vertebrae, being much less dense, did
not require the vertebroplasty needle to be inserted with the aid of a mallet.
Instead the needle could be pushed by hand through the cortical shell and into
the vertebral body.

An additional difference was the approach with the needle, instead of entering
the vertebrae through their pedicles an oblique approach was adopted. This was
due to variation in pedicle diameter between the L1 - L5 lumbar levels and
therefore the potential to damage the region and its load sharing capabilities.
The oblique approach therefore avoided creating this damage to the pedicle-canal
region, especially for the vertebrae with narrower pedicles and instead created
much less damage to the vertebral body.
An illustration of this approach can be seen in \cref{fig:vp-ill} with an example $\mu$CT scan shown in \cref{fig:vp-ill_scan}.


\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=4in]{Chapters/Chapter_HT_images/vp_illustration.png}
  \caption{An illustration showing the approach to needle insertion and cement position.}
  \label{fig:vp-ill}
\end{figure}


\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=4in]{Chapters/Chapter_HT_images/vp_illustration_scan.png}
  \caption{A $\mu$CT scan showing the injected volume of cement at the anterior of the vertebral body with the cement track from the exiting needle to the right. For this specimen cement leaked through the anterior wall, limiting the quantity of cement injected.}
  \label{fig:vp-ill_scan}
\end{figure}

A final difference to the needle insertion methods was a change to the needle.
Here, a side opening needle was used, allowing the cement to be directed into
the anterior-centre region of the vertebral body as opposed to directly out of
the needle end.

It was attempted to inject the largest possible volumes of cement into the vertebrae, mimicking the clinical process.
Like the clinical procedure the injection was stopped upon cement leakage, which generally occurred through one of the vascular channels at either the posterior or anterior portions of the vertebrae.
However, despite stopping the injection upon cement leakage through vascular channels leading from the vertebral body surface inwards, cement loss occurred.
In addition to this, cement was also lost in the needle itself, where as the cement set the amount of cement remaining in the needle became difficult to measure.
This meant that the cement fill could not be measured though the amount of PMMA leaving the syringe due to leakage and needle losses.
Hence cement fill volume was measured using segmented $\mu$CT scans, the methodology of which is described below.

\subsection{Vertebrae Characteristics}

Identifying the different characteristics for the set of lumbar vertebrae has
importance in understanding trends and relationships between the experimental
and computational results. For example a larger degree of anisotropy and hence
more directionality aligned trabeculae would potentially give a more
experimentally stiff vertebra, despite otherwise similar characteristics. Given
that much of the vertebral characteristics depend on the trabecular structure it
is important to understand how this varies between specimens. Furthermore, any
calculations originating from a description of the trabecular structure require
a correct threshold to be applied to the $\mu$CT scan. This threshold describes
the limit of the trabecular bone and hence the start of either marrow or empty
space. To enable a fair comparison between vertebrae a region of interest was
selected from the vertebral body. Given the large variation in cortical shell
thickness, along with certain vertebrae containing large osteophytes and other
extra bone growth, the region of interest (ROI) was selected to be the largest
cylinder that could fit within the vertebral body while not capturing any of the
cortical shell.

\subsubsection{Histograms}

In order to understand the spread of brightness' from the set of lumbar the
histograms of the ROIs were plotted (\cref{fig:normalisedhistogram}).

\begin{figure}[ht!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=4in]{Chapters/Chapter_HT_images/Normalised_Histogram.png}
  \caption{The normalised (with respect to the volume of the ROI) histogram data
    for the 14 lumbar vertebrae.}
  \label{fig:normalisedhistogram}
\end{figure}

The lower greyscale values represent the empty space within the ROI which
translates to regions where the bone marrow has exited the region, most likely
during the freeze thaw cycles. The peak in the histogram at an approximate
greyscale value of 16 is due to the bone marrow. The remaining portion of the
histogram represents bone, where variation is due to the differences in the
mineral content of the bone, with more mineralised bone appearing brighter on
$\mu$CT scans. The specimens ROIs that contain the brighter values are those
that contain osteophytes that contain more dense bone than the other cortical
shell, for example Spine 2 L1.

\subsubsection{Threshold Optimisation}\label{th_opt}


The full resolution scan is imported into imageJ where the threshold optimisation is carried out.
The BoneJ plugin for imageJ is used for all of the trabecular structure metrics, with the optimise threshold tool being the focus here.
This tool is run on the region of interest using the default settings for the connectivity options seen in \cref{tab:bonej}.
This chooses a threshold based on the peak in a connectivity against threshold plot and reports that value.
These values can be seen in \cref{tab:optTH}, showing considerable across the range of vertebrae.
However, the differences in these suggested thresholds can grouped with the spine, for example: the G17 spine has a range between 15 to 17, while the G41 spine has an range between 18 to 20.
This promotes the idea that these differences are due to the bone mineralisation of the bone, especially given that the G17 spine is from a Female and G41 from a male.

However, given that the chosen value for the threshold will directly impact the reported metrics, a consistent value was chosen of 18. Using lower or higher values for the threshold usually results in the trabeculae being described as thicker or thinner respectively.
Hence, the difference in the mineralisation between specimens will still be captured when using a fixed threshold, given that the binary image will be down sampled before material properties are acquired.
The results in \cref{tab:bv_tv_anis} show the BV / TV data and degree of anisotropy values for the 14 specimens using the fixed threshold of 18.
Similar trends to what could be seen from the optimise threshold results can be seen in the BV/TV data, with grouping between the
spines evident.
The Spine 1 spine has a much lower bone volume fraction compared to the other spines, which suggests a more osteoporotic spine, most likely resulting in less stiff vertebra.

\section{Computational Methods}

The split between different modelling methods, computational and experimental is not terribly clear, given that computational methods are employed in the scanning and material property analysis described above.
However, the methods described in this section describe the process used to model non-augmented and augmented vertebrae, with associated sensitivity tests to understand the most appropriate approach to various aspects of the modelling process.




\subsection{Non-augmented Vertebrae Modelling Sensitivity Tests}\label{sec:non_aug_sens}

Given the aims of the project - to include the models generated here into a
larger set of vertebral models for use in statistical shape modelling, it is
useful to model the vertebrae in a scanner independent method. A method for
doing this (BV/TV modelling method) uses a full resolution scan with the bone
regions segmented using a threshold. This full resolution segmented scan is then
downsampled to voxels with edge length of 1 mm, meaning that each voxel has a
greyscale value proportional to the BV/TV value for the region captured by that
voxel. Areas that contain more bone will therefore have a higher greyscale
value. This method is purely dependant on the threshold selected defining the
bone and hence, given that threshold values can be repeatedly and correctly
selected with the methods shown in Section~\ref{th_opt}, it is scanner independent.

Other sensitivity studies present difficulties due to the models reliance on the underlying greyscale background.
This is due to the greyscale optimisation process required to obtain a new conversion factor between the greyscale values and the Young's modulus for every change made to the material properties or boundary conditions of the models.
This is in order to understand the effect the change has on the agreement between experimental and computational results, and because a change to the material properties or boundary conditions may not have a systematic or uniform effect on the results.
Due to this, simple sensitivity tests become difficult, including common convergence studies.

\subsubsection{BV/TV Modelling Method}\label{bvtv_method}

This method gives the opportunity to keep much of the detail that is often lost when downsampling image data.
Specifically, the method described gives the vertebral models much more definition of the cortical shell and internal trabecular structure while maintaining the 1 mm cubed resolution and the computational cost benefits associated with that.
The method follows that found in a study by Robson Brown et al.
\cite{RobsonBrown2014} with a few minor changes. The scans are converted from the ScanCo proprietary ISQ format into a stack of TIFF files using an in house Matlab script, which in additionally reduces reduces the 16 bit data to 8 bit images.

The set of vertebral specimens were split at this stage into two sets, allowing
an understanding of how the bone volume fraction method affects the results compared to the method described in Section~\ref{finite-element-modelling-methods}.
To the set using the bone volume fraction method a threshold was applied at the full 82 $\mu$m resolution.
This threshold was chosen to be a greyscale value of 18, the mean of the values described in section Section~\ref{th_opt} and was applied to the scan stacks in imageJ.
Once the binary stack was created a Gaussian filter was applied, also within imageJ, with $
\sigma_{x,y,z} = 1 $.
This was applied in order to remove speckling found surrounding the end-caps and some of the other noise visible in the scans.
The two stacks of images are then imported into ScanIP; carried
out by opening one stack of images (the original stack) and then importing a
second background (the binary image stack). Both backgrounds are downsampled to
voxel sizes of 1 mm$^3$, with the (originally) binary stack being used to create
the mask for the vertebrae and the original stack being used for the end-caps.
Greyscale material properties for the vertebral mask are taken from the binary
stack, while the remainder of the methods follow the same process as the
original method.
A comparison of the two approaches can be seen in \cref{fig:normal_vs_bv_tv_seg}, where the improved definition of trabecular structure and cortical shell using the bone volume fraction method can be seen in E and F.

\begin{figure}[ht!]

%\subsubsection{Predicting Vertebral Yield Point}\label{predYield}

\subsubsection{Load Position Sensitivity}

In order to understand how the vertebrae respond to different loading positions, eight different positions were tested, shown in \cref{fig:loading_pos}. The same boundary conditions, along with the 1 mm of displacement described above were applied to the different loading positions and the change in stiffness was recorded.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=6cm]{Chapters/Chapter_HT_images/Loading_positions.png}
\caption{The loading positions used for the load variation tests. Position 0 is the original, central loading position, with 1 - 4 being 1 mm away from the centre and 5 - 8 being 2 mm away from the centre.}
\label{fig:loading_pos}
\end{figure}


The results of the load position sensitivity tests (\cref{fig:hum_load}) show that more posterior loads (above denser bone) result in higher stiffness's while anterior loads result in a reduced stiffness. Loads lateral to the central loading point resulted in smaller reductions in the stiffness of models.

It also shows that the effect of movements of 1 mm away from the experimental loading position only changes the stiffness by approximately 5 \%.
Given the resolution of the models is limited to 1 mm, the accuracy of the selection of the experimental loading positions is also limited to 1 mm.
The maximum 5 \% change to the stiffness when posterior or anterior may describe some of the error seen when comparing the experimental and computational results.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Chapters/Chapter_HT_images/human_fossil_loading.png}
\caption{The effect of the loading position for the human lumbar vertebrae, shown as a percentage change compared to a central loading position.}
\label{fig:hum_load}
\end{figure}



\subsubsection{End-cap Depth \& Contact sensitivity}

The stress distribution at the surface of the vertebral body shows high stress at the edges of the cement endcaps, at both the top and bottom of these regions.
Experimentally the endcaps are merely moulded to the shape of the top and bottom of the vertebral body, however, previous work and other studies have used tied contact between the bone and endcaps, removing any motion between the two and locking neighbouring nodes together.
Additionally, the depth of these endcaps varies between 5 mm and 20 mm depending on the shape of the vertebral endplates.
The more concave the vertebral endcap was the more cement was required to fill the space forming a flat cement surface.

Given this variation, tests identifying the effect of changing the endcap depth were carried out using FEA models with different depths of $\pm$ 1, $\pm$ 2 and $\pm$ 3 mm for the top and bottom endcaps independently and together.
Additionally, different interactions between the bone and cement endcaps were tested.
This included the current standard method of a tied interaction and replacing this with a frictionless contact between the two materials.
Finally, the effect of changing the cement endcap depth with the frictionless contact was also investigated, along with variations to the properties of the frictionless contacts.
This was carried out given that, experimentally, there is no tied contact between the PMMA and the bone due to the lack of adhesive properties for the PMMA.

The endcap depth was altered by adding and removing layers within the model file in ScanIP, re-meshing the model and running the files using the same Abaqus python scripts.
Endcap contacts were changed within the Abaqus python scripts, by firstly removing the ties between the endcap and the vertebra.
An interaction property was created with tangential behaviour set to frictionless and normal behavior with properties: $pressureOverclosure=HARD,  constraintEnforcementMethod=Default$ and the final option was experimented with, $allowSeperation=ON/OFF$.
The $allowSeperation$ variable determines whether separation is permitted once contact is established and models ran correctly with it set to its default of $ON$.
However, when experimenting with the effect of loading position, especially with loads applied far from the vertebral centre, the solver struggled to converge.
Disallowing separation after contact was shown to have a small effect on the results (the outputted stiffness) and allowed the models to run to the completion of the job.
The remaining settings were set to the default for a generic contact: 
\begin{minted}{python}
	initialClearance=OMIT, 
	adjustMethod=None, 
	sliding=SMALL, 
	enforcement=NODE_TO_SURFACE, 
	thickness=ON, 
	supplementaryContact=SELECTIVE, 
	interactionProperty=contactName, 
	smooth=0.2, 
	bondingSet=None
\end{minted}

Further tuning of these variables to see if an improved agreement could be achieve would be a simple, though time consuming addition to this sensitivity test due to the greyscale conversion factor optimisation process required to test each option.

\subsection{Material Properties}

The general method for getting material properties for the bone elements in the FE models uses the same approach as used in \cref{material-properties-bov} where the Young's modulus of each element is equal to the greyscale value multiplied by a conversion factor.
The conversion factor is optimised by comparing the computational stiffness against the experimentally acquired stiffness.
For the optimisation process the vertebrae were split into two groups at random, giving a calibration and validation set, allowing a test of the validity of the greyscale conversion factor.
The split of the vertebrae for these two sets can be seen in \cref{tab:calib_valid}.

\begin{table}[ht!]
	\caption{The vertebrae used for the calibration set and the validation set in the optimisation process.}
	\label{tab:calib_valid}
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{c|c}
    Calibration Set   & Validation Set  \\ \hline \hline
    Spine 1 L4 & Spine 1 L1  \\
    Spine 1 L5 & Spine 1 L2\\
    Spine 2 L1 & Spine 1 L3 \\
    Spine 3 L2 & Spine 3 L1\\
    Spine 4 L1 & Spine 3 L3\\
    Spine 4 L2 & Spine 4 L3\\
    Spine 4 L4 & Spine 4 L5 \\
    \hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}


Results from the initial optimisation process using the calibration and validation processes gave good results, in that the agreement of the validation set had CCC values of above 0.5.
The validation set for the ``normal" method had a CCC value of 0.591 and the CCC value for the validate set from the ``bone volume fraction" method gave a value of 0.831.

Given the problems associated with calculating the greyscale conversion factor with various sensitivity tests described in \cref{sec:non_aug_sens}, the calibration and validation sets were only used for the initial test, once using the ``normal" method and once using the ``bone volume fraction" method.
This validated the use of the optimisation process while allowing more accurate greyscale conversion factors for the sensitivity tests and final values given that the input set of human vertebrae was relatively small.

Following the results of the sensitivity tests the final value from the optimisation process for the greyscale conversion factor was 0.0009625.
This was used for the bone properties for all final non-augmented models and augmented models.

The remaining material properties used for all of the models are a Poisson's ration of 0.3 for the bone and endcaps and a Young's modulus of 2.45~GPa for the endcaps. 

\subsection{Modelling Augmentation}

Given the limited validation of models achieved using bovine tail vertebrae (due to the reasons discussed in Section~\ref{bov:results}), a range of different material properties and approaches to modelling the bone-cement interface were investigated.
In addition to varying the material properties of the injected volumes of cement, the effect of using a combination of scans from before and after augmentation has been experimented with.
To achieve this scans of pre/post augmentation were registered.
This method utilised the BV/TV method described earlier, where the non-augmented full resolution thresholded scan is registered to the full resolution augmented scan.

\subsubsection{Registration of $\mu$CT Scans}

Artificial brightening of regions surrounding the internal cement (specifically the concentrated volumes of barium sulphate and the artefacts associated) affect the material properties that are applied to the material, seen in the right-hand image in \cref{fig:reg_demo}.
To bypass this effect the two models, intact and post-augmentation models can be registered - translating them into the same spacial location.
This allows the cement to be defined, masked and modelled based on the post-augmentation scan and the remaining vertebra to be defined from the intact scan, the same background used for the intact models.
While the shape of the vertebra may have been changed over the course of its two loads, this change is less than what can be seen at 1 mm resolution and is not apparent during the registration process carried out at 82 $\mu$m resolution.
Additionally regions that have experienced damage through the insertion of the needle, yet do not contain cement, will also be neglected using this method.
However, the same justification can be made, where this is unlikely to have any affect at 1 mm resolution.

Registration of the images was carried out in 3D Slicer, using scans of the segmented, full-resolution, non-augmented vertebrae and the full-resolution augmented vertebral scans.
The method of registration was a landmark based approach using three landmarks for each vertebra, translating the scan of the augmented vertebrae.
These points were selected at superior of one pedicle, the inferior of the other pedicle and the inferior anterior of the vertebral body.
The selection of these points proved to provide a repeatable registration of the vertebrae, without selecting superfluous landmarks.
Once registered the resulting translated augmented vertebrae scan was cropped with respect to the non-augmented scan to provide an aligned and registered pair of scans.

\begin{figure}[ht!]

  \caption{An illustration of the registration process, registering the non-augmented scan (left) with the augmented scan (right).

  \label{fig:reg_demo}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Registered Scan Model Generation}

The augmented models using the registered scans were created in ScanIP, following similar methods to the bone volume fraction method described in Section~\ref{bvtv_method}.
The initial step was to import the registered augmented scans and apply an initial downsample to a resolution of 0.5 mm$^3$.
This resolution provided enough detail to capture the detail of the injected cement volume without increasing the computational difficulty and therefore time to segment the scans.

To segment the three regions (background, bone and endcaps, and injected cement) it was found that the most reproducible and accurate method was to use the Otsu thresholding process \cite{sezgin2004survey}, a filter that is built in to ScanIP\@.
It was used to find three masks in the scan and works on a threshold clustering method.
In this case searching for three clusters or masks separated by different thresholds and returning a mask that described the background, the bone and endcaps and the cement region.
From this only the cement mask was retained and underwent a flood fill filter, removing empty voxels found within the description of the mask.
The mask and background were then downsampled to 1 mm resolution and cropped to the same dimensions as the non-augmented model.
From the non-augmented model, the masked describing the vertebra, the endcaps and the background of the vertebra where imported.
The origin of the masks coming from the two backgrounds can be seen in \cref{fig:mask_demo}.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=4in]{Chapters/Chapter_HT_images/mask_demo.png}
  \caption{An illustration showing the origin of the masks from the non-augmented scan (left) and the augmented scan (right).}
  \label{fig:mask_demo}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Cement Volume Material Property Tests}



Following the results of the above tests, the final material properties and boundary conditions for the augmented models are below.

The material properties for the yielding interface are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item 1 mm thick layer surrounding the cement volume (ScanIP dilate)
	\item Young's modulus =  0.01 MPa
	\item Poisson's ration = 0.4
	\item Yield stress = 5 Pa, upon which it becomes perfectly plastic
\end{itemize}

The material properties for the cement volume are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Young's modulus =  1.7 GPa
	\item Poisson's ration = 0.4
\end{itemize}

Boundary conditions for the cement region include: tie contacts between the vertebrae and interface, and between the interface and the cement volume.
The remaining material properties and boundary conditions remain the same as with the non-augmented models.

\subsection{Measuring the Vertebral Body \& Augmentation Volume}

While the volume of the vertebral mask can be measured directly within ScanIP or Abaqus, this volume includes the remainder of the pedicles.
The size of the pedicles that remain after their removal during dissection varies between level and spine and is especially different with the level five vertebra, where the shape and size varies dramatically.
To account for this variation and to get a more accurate cement fill percentage for the augmented models elliptic cylinders were fitted to the vertebral body as shown in \cref{fig:cyl_fit}



\begin{figure}[ht!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=5in]{Chapters/Chapter_HT_images/cyl_fit_ful_iso_both.png}
  \caption{A diagram showing the fitting of the cylinders to the vertebral body, where the point cloud describing the vertebra comes from an STL file, the red ring shows the points included in the mid-slice and the central red dot indicates the center of the mid-slice.}
  \label{fig:cyl_fit}
\end{figure}

Vertebrae that contained a vascular channel, seen in \cref{fig:cyl_channel}, had the channel removed by filling the space in ScanIP.
This was carried out for two main reasons: the first was to allow accurate fitting of the cylinder into the vertebral (to avoid the problems shown in \cref{fig:cyl_channel}) and to remove problems with the cement being exposed when modelling augmentation and the extra contacts / interfaces that are created.
Models with the vascular channel removed were compared to the original models and it was found that there was less than 0.5 \% difference for the set.
This was due to the elements used to fill the channel having material properties based on the greyscale, which had values of approximately zero, given the nature of the channel.
Due to the lack of any effect in removing the channel the vertebra models of augmentation did not include the vascular channel.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=5in]{Chapters/Chapter_HT_images/cyl_fit_channel_both.png}
  \caption{An illustration showing the problems that occur with vertebrae that have a distinctive vascular channel and the false cylinder fit that occurs.}
  \label{fig:cyl_channel}
\end{figure}

This was carried out using a set of scripts written in python and rely of having stl files describing the vertebral geometry.
The scripts work by finding the middle slice of a set of nodes that describe the vertebra.
From the middle slice the shape of the ellipse is formed.
Given that the alignment of the vertebrae is uniform, the mid point on the $y$ axis is found by searching for the node furthest away from the weighted center, $\pm$ 2 mm of the weighted centre.
This gives the $a$ measure of the ellipse description.
The $b$ measure is found by using a similar process - searching for the node furthest away from the centre on the $x$ axis, within $\pm$ 2 mm.
The $a$ and $b$ measures gave the shape of the ellipse and the height of the elliptic cylinder was found by raising and lowering the ellipse until a node in the middle $\pm$ 5 mm intersected the ellipse.
This defined the height of the ellipse.
The volume of the ellipse was found (V = $\pi a b h$, where $a$ and $b$ have been described and $h$ is the height) and compared to that of the total vertebral volume, shown in \cref{tab:vertebrae_vol_cyl}.
The percentage reduction in vertebral body volume, from total vertebral body volume to the fitted cylinder volume, varies significantly and is due to changes to the vertebral shape outside of the main vertebral body portion.
For example, Spine 2 L1 was a degenerate vertebrae with extra bone growth at the anterior limits of the vertebral body.
Other large changes were due to the size of the pedicles, where larger vertebrae (Spine 4) had proportionally larger pedicles.

The effect of this change on the relationship between cement fill and change in augmentation stiffness was identified and is shown in \cref{fig:cyl_fit_comparison}.
While there was a change in the relationship, a clear trend between the cement fill percentage and change in stiffness for the majority of the vertebrae is still not evident without including other factors (described in \cref{sec:aug_stiffness_res}).

\section{Results}


\subsection{Experimental Properties}\label{sec:aug_stiffness_res}

Material properties for the vertebrae can be seen in \cref{tab:bv_tv_anis}, with grouping evident for the bone volume fraction measurements.
For example the mean BV/TV value for Spine 1 was $0.159 \pm 0.026$, while the mean for Spine 4 was $0.248 \pm 0.022$ with similar results for the other two spines (although with less vertebra).
Less grouping could be seen between the degree of anisotropy for the vertebrae.

The vertebral stiffness following experimental loading can be seen in \cref{tab:aug_non_aug_stiff} for the non-augmented vertebrae and following vertebral augmentation.
The change in stiffness can be seen in \cref{fig:aug_non_aug_stiffness} where an increase in stiffness was seen Spine 1 L2-L5 and Spine 2 L1, while the remaining vertebrae presented a reduction in stiffness following augmentation.

  \label{fig:aug_non_aug_stiffness}

A strong relationship was found between the percentage fill achieved and the bone volume fraction of the vertebra, where a reduced density of bone resulted in larger quantities of cement being injected into the vertebra before cement leakage occurred.
This relationship can be seen in \cref{fig:cmt_fill_vs_bvtv}.

There was not a clear relationship found between the cement fill of the total vertebral volume and the resulting change in stiffness following augmentation for the set of vertebrae on the whole.
However, trends could be seen when splitting vertebrae into groups with: \textit{a)} dispersed volumes of injected cement and \textit{b)} concentrated volumes of cement.
This can be seen in \cref{fig:cmt_fill_vs_ch_stiff} where a trend ($r=0.83$) can be seen between the percentage fill of the total vertebral volume and the percentage change in stiffness for those vertebrae with concentrated volumes of cement.

Sensitivity tests


The results of modelling the non-augmented vertebrae can be seen in \cref{fig:intact_norm_bvtv}, comparing the initial normal method (the method used with the bovine tail vertebra in the previous chapter) with the best case using the bone volume fraction method and the results of the sensitivity test described previously.
The results show a large improvement using the results of the sensitivity tests and the bone volume fraction method, with a concordance correlation coefficient improving from 0.55 to 0.86.

\section{Discussion}





\subsection{Experimental Results}

Experimentally there was large variation seen in the results, in terms of material properties (BV/TV values), geometry and response to loading.
The experimental response to loading showed a large range in the stiffness of the vertebrae, even for vertebrae with similar volumes and for vertebrae originating from the same spine.
This wide range of stiffness' extends to the augmented vertebral stiffness, although the range does decrease following augmentation.
The variation seen in the intact vertebrae aids the justification for the study, if such a wide range of vertebral properties exists within such a small data set then it explains why such variation is found clinically when identifying the response to vertebroplasty.

Following augmentation five of the 14 vertebrae showed an increase in the stiffness following augmentation, which, given the stiffness of the injected cement compared to that of trabecular bone, is an unexpectedly small number.
Four of the vertebrae that showed an increase in stiffness were from the same spine (Spine 1), which is the spine that had a considerably smaller bone volume fraction compared to the other vertebra from other spines.
Given that this spine had the smallest bone volume fraction it also received the largest quantity of cement, given the relationship between the percentage fill achieved and the bone volume fraction.
This relationship is most likely due to the ease of cement injection before leakage, with more dense vertebrae failing to receive large volumes of cement before the cement found one of the vascular channels (upon which injection was stopped) and less dense vertebrae having more space to receive cement.

Cement volume positions were generally to the anterior of the vertebrae and to the middle of the inferior-superior plane, matching the desired position achieved through the insertion of the needle and angling of the side opening needle tip.
Given the lack of obvious variation in cement positions and shapes it was difficult to characterise the cement distributions, hence, a simplified description of the cement was used.
This simplified description of the cement described whether the cement was in a concentrated volume or dispersed in a larger region or whole vertebra.
Following this characterisation strong relationships were found between the change in stiffness and percentage fill, if only those vertebrae with a concentrated volume of cement were included.
Suggesting that distributed volumes of cement are difficult to predict and should be avoided when carrying out the procedure using fluoroscopy, especially with more dense vertebrae where the likelihood or disperse volumes of cement increased.


To summarise the change in stiffness following augmentation based on the material properties of the vertebrae, the following features have the greatest effect:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A smaller bone volume fraction results in larger quantities of cement being injected before leakage occurs.
    \item If the volume of cement is contained in a concentrated volume then the greater the volume of cement then the larger the increase in stiffness following augmentation.
    \item If the volume of cement is dispersed through the vertebral body then there is no relationship between the volume of cement injected and its effect of the vertebral stiffness.
    \item Concentrated volumes of cement are more likely if the bone volume fraction of the vertebra is smaller.
\end{enumerate}

The effects of vertebral geometry and material properties on the response to augmentation will be investigated further using statistical shape modelling in \cref{PCA_CHAP}

\subsection{Limitations Regarding Specimen Numbers \& Vertebral Features}

One of the main limitations to the study is the numbers of vertebrae included in in the set.
Having four human spines with a limited number of lumbar vertebrae available from each spine, meant that only 14 out of a possible 20 vertebrae were able to be tested.
This meant that there was a skew towards the top of the lumbar section with limited numbers of L4 and L5 vertebrae.
Such skews to the data set have effects to any statistics applied to the data set and will be discussed more thoroughly in the PCA discussion chapter in Section~\ref{pca_disc}.
More relevant to modelling the vertebrae is the effect this has on the determination and optimisation of the greyscale conversion factor.
The large change in geometry from L4 to L5, rather that the gradual change between L1 to L4, introduces questions about the response to loading (and augmentation) for this vertebra in particular and how it differs from other levels.
A resolution to this limitation would be to increase the specimen numbers and look at vertebral levels in isolation; identifying level specific differences and properties.
Variation at different vertebral levels may require level specific greyscale conversion factors, such as those required when modelling different animal species \cite{zapata2017methodology}.
However, within the current set of vertebrae greater variation was found between spine rather than level (for BV/TV, stiffness and vertebral body volume), even when including L5 vertebrae.
Suggesting that segregation of vertebral levels is unnecessary for the current specimen set. 

Another limitation of the study is the age range and limited information regarding vertebral health.
Because of this unknown vertebral quality or health it was decided to skip the initial load to failure carried out in the bovine tail study.
While no evidence of fractures could be seen in the $\mu$CT scans, other than slight wedge shapes, there was no evidence of the bovine tail vertebrae having succumbed to fracture in $\mu$CT either, despite clear fractures on load displacement curves.
Therefore the state of the vertebrae was relatively unknown pre-augmentation and the study therefore becomes an investigation into the effects of prophylactic vertebroplasty, although with the possibility that some of the vertebrae were fractured \textit{in vivo}.




\subsection{Computational Results}

The improvement in the agreement between computational stiffness and the experimental stiffness results using the bone volume fraction method and the results of the sensitivity tests is significant and provides a good foundation for modelling the more challenging augmented models.
The improvement using the bone volume fraction method in isolation (without the results of the other sensitivity tests) showed a large improvement over the normal method.
The normal method performed similarly on the bovine tail vertebrae as with the human lumbar vertebrae, with a CCC = 0.49 for bovine tail vertebrae and CCC = 0.55 for the human vertebrae.
The improvement using the bone volume fraction method is most likely due to the added definition of the trabecular bone and cortical shell, especially given how important the correct representation of load sharing is for accurate models \cite{eswaran2006cortical}.
Having greater definition of the cortical shell and trabecular bone alignment allows much more accurate descriptions of the load transfer through the vertebrae, rather than the more simple description with the more homogenised material properties of the normal method.

This method also removed any effect that the bone marrow, where, given the freeze/thaw cycles the marrow leaks from the vertebrae giving vertebral scans with portions of the bone marrow missing and therefore changing the greyscale background and material properties.
Due to the initial segmentation at 82 $\mu$m using the BV/TV method the bone marrow is not present in the segmented full resolution or downsampled scans and therefore has no impact on the material properties of the models.
Conversely, using the normal method, areas lacking bone marrow would have a lower Young's modulus and areas with bone marrow would have higher Young's moduli, not corresponding to the actual properties of these regions and changing the load distribution.
